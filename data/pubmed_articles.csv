Neurobiology of emotional trauma.,"An emotional trauma may induce a cascade of neurobiological events that have long-lasting consequences even altered gene expression. Early abuse and neglect can deregulate the child's developing neurobiological system by reducing its resistance to stressful events, leading to later problems of emotional regulation. Children who have been subjected to physical or emotional abuse tend to pay more attention to signs that contain anger and are hypersensitive to threat. Scar hypothesis and the theories of behavioural sensitization or electrophysiological kindling suggest that emotional traumas may leave traces that persist even after remission of depression, and render individuals vulnerable to the onset of new episodes, even under the influence of only moderate psychosocial stress. Unfavorable early social experiences, such as emotional abuse or institutionalization can affect the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex. Exposure to repeated emotional stressors, even in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses, has been shown to produce increased synapse formation and dendritic growth in basolateral amygdala, dendritic retraction in the hippocampus, and anxiety-like behavior against specific triggers, such as phobia of open spaces. During the narration of an emotionally traumatic event, there is activation of the limbic system, the right amygdale, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, there is an activation of the anterior insula, which records the physical impact of negative emotions, and the anterior and medial temporal cortex, which are involved in negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD patients have found hypoactivity in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate and thalamic areas, indicating the effects of PTSD on executive function, attention and cognitive, memorial, and affective and somatosensory integration. One of the most replicated findings in studies involving PTSD patients is the decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found a negative correlation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation. A recent meta-analysis revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and emotional trauma and suggested that global brain volume reductions can distinguish PTSD from major depression. Neuroimaging studies of successful eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment have consistently shown that patients exhibited increased frontal lobe activation. Moving beyond diagnostic boundaries, focusing on the causal interplay between specific traumatic processes and using standardized measures, are useful directions for future research in memory, emotion and emotional trauma.",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki
Holocaust Exposure Induced Intergenerational Effects on FKBP5 Methylation.,The involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in intergenerational transmission of stress effects has been demonstrated in animals but not in humans.,Biological psychiatry
"[Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a consequence of the interaction between an individual genetic susceptibility, a traumatogenic event and a social context].","Why are some individuals more likely than others to develop a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the face of similar levels of trauma exposure? Monitoring the traumatic process combining the antecedents, the determinants of the psychic trauma and the acute symptoms can clarify the causes of the final onset of a chronic repetition syndrome. Epidemiologic research has clarified risk factors that increase the likelihood of PTSD after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. PTSD is an interaction between a subject, a traumatogenic factor and a social context. With each epidemiological, psychopathological and more particularly neurogenetic study, we will expand on the impact of these interactions on the therapeutic treatment of psycho-traumatised persons.",L'Encephale
Epigenetic upregulation of FKBP5 by aging and stress contributes to NF-κB-driven inflammation and cardiovascular risk.,"Aging and psychosocial stress are associated with increased inflammation and disease risk, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Because both aging and stress are also associated with lasting epigenetic changes, a plausible hypothesis is that stress along the lifespan could confer disease risk through epigenetic effects on molecules involved in inflammatory processes. Here, by combining large-scale analyses in human cohorts with experiments in cells, we report that FKBP5, a protein implicated in stress physiology, contributes to these relations. Across independent human cohorts (total <i>n</i> > 3,000), aging synergized with stress-related phenotypes, measured with childhood trauma and major depression questionnaires, to epigenetically up-regulate <i>FKBP5</i> expression. These age/stress-related epigenetic effects were recapitulated in a cellular model of replicative senescence, whereby we exposed replicating human fibroblasts to stress (glucocorticoid) hormones. Unbiased genome-wide analyses in human blood linked higher <i>FKBP5</i> mRNA with a proinflammatory profile and altered NF-κB-related gene networks. Accordingly, experiments in immune cells showed that higher <i>FKBP5</i> promotes inflammation by strengthening the interactions of NF-κB regulatory kinases, whereas opposing FKBP5 either by genetic deletion (CRISPR/Cas9-mediated) or selective pharmacological inhibition prevented the effects on NF-κB. Further, the age/stress-related epigenetic signature enhanced <i>FKBP5</i> response to NF-κB through a positive feedback loop and was present in individuals with a history of acute myocardial infarction, a disease state linked to peripheral inflammation. These findings suggest that aging/stress-driven FKBP5-NF-κB signaling mediates inflammation, potentially contributing to cardiovascular risk, and may thus point to novel biomarker and treatment possibilities.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
DNA methylation correlates of PTSD: Recent findings and technical challenges.,"There is increasing evidence that epigenetic factors play a critical role in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), by mediating the impact of environmental exposures to trauma on the regulation of gene expression. DNA methylation is one epigenetic process that has been highly studied in PTSD. This review will begin by providing an overview of DNA methylation (DNAm) methods, and will then highlight two major biological systems that have been identified in the epigenetic regulation in PTSD: (a) the immune system and (b) the stress response system. In addition to candidate gene approaches, we will review novel strategies to study epigenome-wide PTSD-related effects, including epigenome-wide algorithms that distill information from many loci into a single summary score (e.g., measures of ""epigenetic age"" which have been associated with PTSD). This review will also cover recent epigenome wide association studies (EWAS) of PTSD, and biological pathway models used to identify gene sets enriched in PTSD. Finally, we address technical and methodological advances and challenges to the field, and highlight exciting directions for future research.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry
Epigenetic Mechanisms of Traumatic Brain Injuries.,"Of all types of injuries, traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are most likely to result in death or permanent physical or mental disabilities. With the increased frequency of military operations, terror attacks, sports activities, and road mishaps, TBIs are increasingly becoming a serious public health concern. Patients who meet with moderate-to-severe TBI suffer from a constellation of cognitive deficits and phenotypes due to diffuse axonal injury. On the contrary, minimal TBI precipitates in long-term behavioral complications commonly referred to as post-traumatic stress disorders, which consist of depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and so on. During the last decade, epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone posttranslational modifications, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNAs, have received reasonable attention by scientists studying the neurobiology of TBI. Chromatin remodeling sculpted by various epigenetic factors in different parts of the brain controls many intricate processes involved in important neural functions. Although stable and dogmatic, the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications has attracted special attention for their emerging potential in therapeutic development. Herein, we offer an overview of recent observations on epigenetic pathways that are likely involved in shaping neural function and maintain the state of neuropathology in response to traumatic events.",Progress in molecular biology and translational science
Schizotaxia revisited.,"A conjectured neural integrative defect (schizotaxia), due to a dominant schizogene completely penetrant for a parametric aberration in synaptic signal selectivity (hypokrisia), gives rise under ordinary social learning regimens to schizotypy, a personality showing ambivalence, aversive drift, dereism, autism, and cognitive slippage. Given unfavorable polygenic potentiators (eg, introversion, hypohedonia, and anxiety) and adverse life experiences (eg, childhood trauma or adult misfortune), around 10% develop schizophrenia. That schizophrenia is basically a neurologic disorder does not contradict whatever is known about its psychodynamics, nor preclude efficacy for psychotherapy or other psychosocial interventions. Research should concentrate on soft neurology and psychophysiology as indicators, being closer in the causal chain to the schizogene than psychometric, social, or high-level cognitive processes. Taxometric statistics are appropriate to testing a major locus model not simplistically formulated.",Archives of general psychiatry
Modeling gene × environment interactions in PTSD using human neurons reveals diagnosis-specific glucocorticoid-induced gene expression.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop following severe trauma, but the extent to which genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to individual clinical outcomes is unknown. Here, we compared transcriptional responses to hydrocortisone exposure in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from combat veterans with PTSD (n = 19 hiPSC and n = 20 PBMC donors) and controls (n = 20 hiPSC and n = 20 PBMC donors). In neurons only, we observed diagnosis-specific glucocorticoid-induced changes in gene expression corresponding with PTSD-specific transcriptomic patterns found in human postmortem brains. We observed glucocorticoid hypersensitivity in PTSD neurons, and identified genes that contribute to this PTSD-dependent glucocorticoid response. We find evidence of a coregulated network of transcription factors that mediates glucocorticoid hyper-responsivity in PTSD. These findings suggest that induced neurons represent a platform for examining the molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD, identifying biomarkers of stress response, and conducting drug screening to identify new therapeutics.",Nature neuroscience
Possible Reversal of PTSD-Related DNA Methylation by Sympathetic Blockade.,"Studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level increase is associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk. BDNF may be a ""missing-link"" that mediates the interaction between genetics, environment, and the sympathetic system. Trauma has been shown to induce DNA methylation that in turn can increase BDNF concentration due to increased gene expression. Therapies that focus on the reduction of beta-NGF (BNGF) levels may impact PTSD symptoms. The focus of this paper is to discuss possible effect of stellate ganglion block (SGB) on epigenetic changes noted with PTSD mediated by BDNF and NGF. Stellate ganglion block has recently shown significant therapeutic efficacy for treatment of PTSD symptoms. Previously reported theoretical mechanisms of SGB impact on PTSD have focused on likely reduction of NGF, leading to eventual loss of extraneous sympathetic nerve growth, eventually leading to reduction of secondary norepinephrine level, which in turn is hypothesized to reduce PTSD symptoms. We used PUBMED to obtain available data following a search for the following: DNA, neurotrophic factors, post-traumatic stress disorder, and demethylation following local anesthetic application. A number of articles meeting criteria were found and reviewed. Based on the evidence summarized, trauma can lead to DNA methylation, as well as BNGF/NGF level increase, which in turn starts a cascade of sympathetic sprouting, leading to increased brain norepinephrine, and finally symptomatic PTSD. Cascade reversal may occur in part by demethylation of DNA caused by application of local anesthetic to the stellate ganglion.",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN
FOXO1 reshapes neutrophils to aggravate acute brain damage and promote late depression after traumatic brain injury.,"Neutrophils are traditionally viewed as first responders but have a short onset of action in response to traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the heterogeneity, multifunctionality, and time-dependent modulation of brain damage and outcome mediated by neutrophils after TBI remain poorly understood.",Military Medical Research
Recent Genetics and Epigenetics Approaches to PTSD.,"Following a life-threatening traumatic exposure, about 10% of those exposed are at considerable risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a severe and disabling syndrome characterized by uncontrollable intrusive memories, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal in addition to impaired cognition and negative emotion symptoms. This review will explore recent genetic and epigenetic approaches to PTSD that explain some of the differential risk following trauma exposure.",Current psychiatry reports
"Early life trauma, depression and the glucocorticoid receptor gene--an epigenetic perspective.","Hopes to identify genetic susceptibility loci accounting for the heritability seen in unipolar depression have not been fully realized. Family history remains the 'gold standard' for both risk stratification and prognosis in complex phenotypes such as depression. Meanwhile, the physiological mechanisms underlying life-event triggers for depression remain opaque. Epigenetics, comprising heritable changes in gene expression other than alterations of the nucleotide sequence, may offer a way to deepen our understanding of the aetiology and pathophysiology of unipolar depression and optimize treatments. A heuristic target for exploring the relevance of epigenetic changes in unipolar depression is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene (NR3C1) has been found to be susceptible to epigenetic modification, specifically DNA methylation, in the context of environmental stress such as early life trauma, which is an established risk for depression later in life.",Psychological medicine
DNA methylation GrimAge acceleration in US military veterans with PTSD.,"Epigenetic alterations in DNA methylation might mediate gene expression effects of trauma underlying PTSD symptoms, or effects of PTSD on related health problems. PTSD is associated with all-cause morbidity and premature mortality, suggesting accelerated biological aging. We measured genome-wide DNA methylation (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) in whole blood in a treatment study for combat-related PTSD - ""PROGrESS"", a multisite RCT comparing sertraline plus enhanced medication management (SERT + EMM), prolonged exposure (PE) therapy plus placebo (PE + PLB), and the combination (SERT + PE). DNA methylation was measured in 140 US military veterans who served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan (112 current PTSD cases enrolled in a PTSD treatment study and 28 veterans without PTSD history controls), and also 59 non-trauma exposed controls at baseline posttreatment (24 weeks after baseline). Increased DNA methylation GrimAge acceleration (p = 8.8e-09) was observed in patients with PTSD compared to a pooled control group (trauma exposed and non-trauma exposed), suggesting a higher risk of premature mortality in those with PTSD. There was no difference in GrimAge acceleration between combat trauma and non-trauma exposed controls. No treatment-related changes in GrimAge acceleration were found in within-subject comparisons of PTSD patients pre- to post-treatment.",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology
DNA Methylation of Genes Involved in the HPA Axis in Presence of Suicide Behavior: A Systematic Review.,"DNA methylation in genes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been associated with suicide behavior. Through a systematic review, we aimed to evaluate DNA methylation levels of the genes involved in the HPA pathway and their association with suicide behavior. A search of articles was performed using PubMed and Science Direct, EBSCO. The terms included were ""DNA methylation"", ""suicide"", ""epigenetics"", ""HPA axis"" and ""suicide behavior"". This systematic review was performed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Six studies comprising 743 cases and 761 controls were included in this systematic review. The studies included individuals with suicide ideation, suicide attempts or completed suicide and childhood trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or depression. One study reported hypermethylation in GR in childhood trauma, while two studies found hypermethylation of NR3C1 in childhood trauma and major depressive disorder (MDD). Only one study reported hypermethylation in BNDF in people with MDD. FKBP5 was found to be hypermethylated in people with MDD. Another study reported hypermethylation in CRHBP. SKA2 was reported to be hypermethylated in one study and another study found hypomethylated both in populations with PTSD. CRHR1 was found to be hypermethylated in people with MDD, and the last study found hypomethylation in CRH. Our result showed that patients with suicidal behavior showed a DNA methylation state of genes of the HPA axis in association with psychiatric comorbidity and with adverse events. Genes of the HPA axis could play a role in suicidal behavior associated with adverse events and pathologies. As a result, DNA methylation levels, proteins, and genes involved in the HPA axis could be considered for the search for biomarkers for the prevention of suicidal behavior in future studies.",Brain sciences
DNA methylation and psychotherapy response in trauma-exposed men with appetitive aggression.,"Exposure to violence can lead to appetitive aggression (AA), the positive feeling and fascination associated with violence, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterised by hyperarousal, reexperience and feelings of ongoing threat. Psychotherapeutic interventions may act via DNA methylation, an environmentally sensitive epigenetic mechanism that can influence gene expression. We investigated epigenetic signatures of psychotherapy for PTSD and AA symptoms in South African men with chronic trauma exposure. Participants were assigned to one of three groups: narrative exposure therapy for forensic offender rehabilitation (FORNET), cognitive behavioural therapy or waiting list control (n = 9-10/group). Participants provided saliva and completed the Appetitive Aggression Scale and PTSD Symptom Severity Index at baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-up. The relationship, over time, between methylation in 22 gene promoter region sites, symptom scores, and treatment was assessed using linear mixed models. Compared to baseline, PTSD and AA symptom severity were significantly reduced at 8 and 16 months, respectively, in the FORNET group. Increased methylation of genes implicated in dopaminergic neurotransmission (NR4A2) and synaptic plasticity (AUTS2) was associated with reduced PTSD symptom severity in participants receiving FORNET. Analyses across participants revealed a proportional relationship between AA and methylation of TFAM, a gene involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis.",Psychiatry research
Altered gene expression and PTSD symptom dimensions in World Trade Center responders.,"Despite experiencing a significant trauma, only a subset of World Trade Center (WTC) rescue and recovery workers developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Identification of biomarkers is critical to the development of targeted interventions for treating disaster responders and potentially preventing the development of PTSD in this population. Analysis of gene expression from these individuals can help in identifying biomarkers of PTSD. We established a well-phenotyped sample of 371 WTC responders, recruited from a longitudinal WTC responder cohort using stratified random sampling, by obtaining blood, self-reported and clinical interview data. Using bulk RNA-sequencing from whole blood, we examined the association between gene expression and WTC-related PTSD symptom severity on (i) highest lifetime Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score, (ii) past-month CAPS score, and (iii) PTSD symptom dimensions using a 5-factor model of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal symptoms. We corrected for sex, age, genotype-derived principal components and surrogate variables. Finally, we performed a meta-analysis with existing PTSD studies (total N = 1016), using case/control status as the predictor and correcting for these variables. We identified 66 genes significantly associated with total highest lifetime CAPS score (FDR-corrected p < 0.05), and 31 genes associated with total past-month CAPS score. Our more granular analyses of PTSD symptom dimensions identified additional genes that did not reach statistical significance in our analyses with total CAPS scores. In particular, we identified 82 genes significantly associated with lifetime anxious arousal symptoms. Several genes significantly associated with multiple PTSD symptom dimensions and total lifetime CAPS score (SERPINA1, RPS6KA1, and STAT3) have been previously associated with PTSD. Geneset enrichment of these findings has identified pathways significant in metabolism, immune signaling, other psychiatric disorders, neurological signaling, and cellular structure. Our meta-analysis revealed 10 genes that reached genome-wide significance, all of which were downregulated in cases compared to controls (CIRBP, TMSB10, FCGRT, CLIC1, RPS6KB2, HNRNPUL1, ALDOA, NACA, ZNF429 and COPE). Additionally, cellular deconvolution highlighted an enrichment in CD4 T cells and eosinophils in responders with PTSD compared to controls. The distinction in significant genes between total lifetime CAPS score and the anxious arousal symptom dimension of PTSD highlights a potential biological difference in the mechanism underlying the heterogeneity of the PTSD phenotype. Future studies should be clear about methods used to analyze PTSD status, as phenotypes based on PTSD symptom dimensions may yield different gene sets than combined CAPS score analysis. Potential biomarkers implicated from our meta-analysis may help improve therapeutic target development for PTSD.",Molecular psychiatry
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in female veterans with military sexual trauma and comorbid PTSD/MDD.,"Military sexual trauma (MST) is a prevalent issue within the U.S. military. Victims are more likely to develop comorbid diseases such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Nonetheless, not everyone who suffers from MST develops PTSD and/or MDD. DNA methylation, which can regulate gene expression, might give us insight into the molecular mechanisms behind this discrepancy. Therefore, we sought to identify genomic loci and enriched biological pathways that differ between patients with and without MST, PTSD, and MDD.",Journal of affective disorders
Global DNA methylation in suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in schizophrenia.,"Suicidal behavior is influenced by many risk factors such as childhood trauma, stressful life events, genetic factors, and severe mental illnesses. Suicidal ideation is present in 50% of schizophrenia patients and is associated with an elevated risk of suicide attempt. Studies have shown that epigenetic mechanisms are associated with suicidal behavior in schizophrenia. Although several studies have suggested the importance of epigenetic factors in suicidal ideation and behavior, no studies have investigated global methylation in association with these two phenotypes. This study investigated global methylation level/change in association with current and emergent suicidal ideation and also with suicide attempt. Forty-seven schizophrenia patients were assessed for the association between global methylation and suicide attempt, and a subsample of these patients (n = 27) was assessed for current suicidal ideation. Afterwards, we performed a longitudinal analysis in which global methylation changes during a 3-month follow-up were compared between patients with and without emergent suicidal ideation. This methylation analysis did not find evidence for a significant association between global methylation and suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. To date, there are no robust biomarkers predicting suicidal ideation or behavior in psychotic patients. This study is the first to investigate global methylation in predicting suicidal ideation and behavior. Although we did not find evidence for an association between global methylation and these phenotypes, our findings may offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms linked to suicide. Future investigation may measure global methylation in association with suicidal ideation or behavior in larger samples.",Psychiatric genetics
Stress and trauma: BDNF control of dendritic-spine formation and regression.,"Chronic restraint stress leads to increases in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein in some regions of the brain, e.g. the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) but decreases in other regions such as the CA3 region of the hippocampus and dendritic spine density increases or decreases in line with these changes in BDNF. Given the powerful influence that BDNF has on dendritic spine growth, these observations suggest that the fundamental reason for the direction and extent of changes in dendritic spine density in a particular region of the brain under stress is due to the changes in BDNF there. The most likely cause of these changes is provided by the stress initiated release of steroids, which readily enter neurons and alter gene expression, for example that of BDNF. Of particular interest is how glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids tend to have opposite effects on BDNF gene expression offering the possibility that differences in the distribution of their receptors and of their downstream effects might provide a basis for the differential transcription of the BDNF genes. Alternatively, differences in the extent of methylation and acetylation in the epigenetic control of BDNF transcription are possible in different parts of the brain following stress. Although present evidence points to changes in BDNF transcription being the major causal agent for the changes in spine density in different parts of the brain following stress, steroids have significant effects on downstream pathways from the TrkB receptor once it is acted upon by BDNF, including those that modulate the density of dendritic spines. Finally, although glucocorticoids play a canonical role in determining BDNF modulation of dendritic spines, recent studies have shown a role for corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) in this regard. There is considerable improvement in the extent of changes in spine size and density in rodents with forebrain specific knockout of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) even when the glucocorticoid pathways are left intact. It seems then that CRF does have a role to play in determining BDNF control of dendritic spines.",Progress in neurobiology
The body keeps the score: The neurobiological profile of traumatized adolescents.,"Trauma-related disorders are debilitating psychiatric conditions that affect people who have directly or indirectly witnessed adversities. Experiencing multiple types of traumas appears to be common during childhood, and even more so during adolescence. Dramatic brain/body transformations occurring during adolescence may provide a highly responsive substrate to external stimuli and lead to trauma-related vulnerability conditions, such as internalizing (anxiety, depression, anhedonia, withdrawal) and externalizing (aggression, delinquency, conduct disorders) problems. Analyzing relations among neuronal, endocrine, immune, and biochemical signatures of trauma and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, including the role of personality traits in shaping these conducts, this review highlights that the marked effects of traumatic experience on the brain/body involve changes at nearly every level of analysis, from brain structure, function and connectivity to endocrine and immune systems, from gene expression (including in the gut) to the development of personality.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews
Posttraumatic stress disorder: from gene discovery to disease biology.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex mental disorder afflicting approximately 7% of the population. The diverse number of traumatic events and the wide array of symptom combinations leading to PTSD diagnosis contribute substantial heterogeneity to studies of the disorder. Genomic and complimentary-omic investigations have rapidly increased our understanding of the heritable risk for PTSD. In this review, we emphasize the contributions of genome-wide association, epigenome-wide association, transcriptomic, and neuroimaging studies to our understanding of PTSD etiology. We also discuss the shared risk between PTSD and other complex traits derived from studies of causal inference, co-expression, and brain morphological similarities. The investigations completed so far converge on stark contrasts in PTSD risk between sexes, partially attributed to sex-specific prevalence of traumatic experiences with high conditional risk of PTSD. To further understand PTSD biology, future studies should focus on detecting risk for PTSD while accounting for substantial cohort-level heterogeneity (e.g. civilian v. combat-exposed PTSD cases or PTSD risk among cases exposed to specific traumas), expanding ancestral diversity among study cohorts, and remaining cognizant of how these data influence social stigma associated with certain traumatic events among underrepresented minorities and/or high-risk populations.",Psychological medicine
Diabetes impairs cardioprotective function of endothelial progenitor cell-derived extracellular vesicles via H3K9Ac inhibition.,"<b>Background and Purpose:</b> Myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic patients results in higher mortality and morbidity. We and others have previously shown that bone marrow-endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote cardiac neovascularization and attenuate ischemic injury. Lately, small extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as major paracrine effectors mediating the benefits of stem cell therapy. Modest clinical outcomes of autologous cell-based therapies suggest diabetes-induced EPC dysfunction and may also reflect their EV derivatives. Moreover, studies suggest that post-translational histone modifications promote diabetes-induced vascular dysfunctions. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that diabetic EPC-EVs may lose their post-injury cardiac reparative function by modulating histone modification in endothelial cells (ECs). <b>Methods:</b> We collected EVs from the culture medium of EPCs isolated from non-diabetic (db/+) and diabetic (db/db) mice and examined their effects on recipient ECs and cardiomyocytes <i>in vitro,</i> and their reparative function in permanent ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) myocardial ischemic injuries <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Results:</b> Compared to db/+ EPC-EVs, db/db EPC-EVs promoted EC and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and repressed tube-forming capacity of ECs. <i>In vivo</i>, db/db EPC-EVs depressed cardiac function, reduced capillary density, and increased fibrosis compared to db/+ EPC-EV treatments after MI. Moreover, in the I/R MI model, db/+ EPC-EV-mediated acute cardio-protection was lost with db/db EPC-EVs, and db/db EPC-EVs increased immune cell infiltration, infarct area, and plasma cardiac troponin-I. Mechanistically, histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) was significantly decreased in cardiac ECs treated with db/db EPC-EVs compared to db/+ EPC-EVs. The H3K9Ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) results further revealed that db/db EPC-EVs reduced H3K9Ac level on angiogenic, cell survival, and proliferative genes in cardiac ECs. We found that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA), partly restored diabetic EPC-EV-impaired H3K9Ac levels, tube formation and viability of ECs, and enhanced cell survival and proliferative genes, <i>Pdgfd</i> and <i>Sox12</i>, expression. Moreover, we observed that VPA treatment improved db/db EPC-mediated post-MI cardiac repair and functions. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings unravel that diabetes impairs EPC-EV reparative function in the ischemic heart, at least partially, through HDACs-mediated H3K9Ac downregulation leading to transcriptional suppression of angiogenic, proliferative and cell survival genes in recipient cardiac ECs. Thus, HDAC inhibitors may potentially be used to restore the function of diabetic EPC and other stem cells for autologous cell therapy applications.",Theranostics
PTSD and gene variants: new pathways and new thinking.,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder which can develop as a result of exposure to a traumatic event and is associated with significant functional impairment. Family and twin studies have found that risk for PTSD is associated with an underlying genetic vulnerability and that more than 30% of the variance associated with PTSD is related to a heritable component. Using a fear conditioning model to conceptualize the neurobiology of PTSD, three primary neuronal systems have been investigated - the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system, and neurocircuitry interconnecting the limbic system and frontal cortex. The majority of the initial investigations into main effects of candidate genes hypothesized to be associated with PTSD risk have been negative, but studies examining the interaction of genetic polymorphisms with specific environments in predicting PTSD have produced several positive results which have increased our understanding of the determinants of risk and resilience in the aftermath of trauma. Promising avenues of inquiry into the role of epigenetic modification have also been proposed to explain the enduring impact of environmental exposures which occur during key, often early, developmental periods on gene expression. Studies of PTSD endophenotypes, which are heritable biomarkers associated with a circumscribed trait within the more complex psychiatric disorder, may be more directly amenable to analysis of the underlying genetics and neural pathways and have provided promising targets for elucidating the neurobiology of PTSD. Knowledge of the genetic underpinnings and neuronal pathways involved in the etiology and maintenance of PTSD will allow for improved targeting of primary prevention amongst vulnerable individuals or populations, as well as timely, targeted treatment interventions.

A review of epigenetic contributions  to post-traumatic stress disorder .,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a syndrome which serves as a classic example of psychiatric disorders that result from the intersection of nature and nurture, or gene and environment. By definition, PTSD requires the experience of a traumatic exposure, and yet data suggest that the risk for PTSD in the aftermath of trauma also has a heritable (genetic) component. Thus, PTSD appears to require both a biological (genetic) predisposition that differentially alters how the individual responds to or recovers from trauma exposure. Epigenetics is defined as the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, and more recently it has come to refer to direct alteration of DNA regulation, but without altering the primary sequence of DNA, or the genetic code. With regards to PTSD, epigenetics provides one way for environmental exposure to be ""written"" upon the genome, as a direct result of gene and environment (trauma) interactions. This review provides an overview of the main currently understood types of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, histone regulation of chromatin, and noncoding RNA regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, we examine recent literature related to how these methods of epigenetic regulation may be involved in differential risk and resilience for PTSD in the aftermath of trauma. .",Dialogues in clinical neuroscience
Epigenetic aging and PTSD outcomes in the immediate aftermath of trauma.,"Psychological trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with advanced epigenetic age. However, whether epigenetic aging measured at the time of trauma predicts the subsequent development of PTSD outcomes is unknown. Moreover, the neural substrates underlying posttraumatic outcomes associated with epigenetic aging are unclear.",Psychological medicine
Epigenetic clocks may come out of rhythm-implications for the estimation of chronological age in forensic casework.,"There is a growing perception that DNA methylation may be influenced by exogenous and endogenous parameters. Knowledge of these factors is of great relevance for the interpretation of DNA-methylation data for the estimation of chronological age in forensic casework. We performed a literature review to identify parameters, which might be of relevance for the prediction of chronological age based on DNA methylation. The quality of age predictions might particularly be influenced by lifetime adversities (chronic stress, trauma/post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), violence, low socioeconomic status/education), cancer, obesity and related diseases, infectious diseases (especially HIV and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections), sex, ethnicity and exposure to toxins (alcohol, smoking, air pollution, pesticides). Such factors may alter the DNA methylation pattern and may explain the partly high deviations between epigenetic age and chronological age in single cases (despite of low mean absolute deviations) that can also be observed with ""epigenetic clocks"" comprising a high number of CpG sites. So far, only few publications dealing with forensic age estimation address these confounding factors. Future research should focus on the identification of further relevant confounding factors and the development of models that are ""robust"" against the influence of such biological factors by systematic investigations under targeted inclusion of diverse and defined cohorts.",International journal of legal medicine
Trauma context exerts intergenerational effects on child mental health via DNA methylation.,"Many people experience traumatic or negative events, but few develop mental health issues as a result.

Potential of microRNAs as novel targets in the alleviation of pathological fear.,"The current treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), phobias and other anxiety disorders, remains insufficient particularly in producing long-lasting full symptom control. Dysfunctional fear processing is common in these disorders, including a deficiency in fear-inhibitory mechanisms and impairment in the ability to discriminate between safety and danger cues. Research has aimed to elucidate brain circuitries, neurotransmitters and downstream signaling pathways important in the alleviation of aberrant fear, with a specific focus on mechanisms modulating fear memory and its behavioral expression. MicroRNAs (miRNA) as ""fine tuners"" of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level have emerged as critical regulators of such mechanisms important in both, the generation and the inhibition of fear memories. Along these lines, abnormal expression of miRNAs has been associated with different fear-related disorders. After providing an updated overview on the involvement of miRNAs in fear learning mechanisms, we summarize and discuss in particular those studies in which the implication of miRNAs in successful inhibition of fear has been explored. For a better overview, we dissociate the different modes of fear alleviation investigated in this regard and present studies in rodents demonstrating that specific miRNAs are involved in the destabilization of fear by interfering with consolidation/reconsolidation mechanisms or that they are associated with the generation of fear extinction or safety learning.

Potential Societal and Cultural Implications of Transgenerational Epigenetic Methylation of Trauma and PTSD: Pathology or Resilience?,"Psychological trauma is unique in that it is an environmental event that could induce biological changes and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or other mood disorders in some patients. On the other hand, there may be no psychopathology (in most cases), or even sometimes post-traumatic growth and resilience. According to the DSM-5, trauma is a prerequisite for PTSD and traumatic stress disorder, but not for depressive episodes or mood disorders, or other psychiatric conditions. This paper brings attention to the preliminary literature on transgenerational inheritance due to trauma exposure and its societal and cultural implications. There is accumulating evidence that exposure to trauma can be passed transgenerationally through epigenetic inheritance leading to changes in gene expression and possible disorders or resilience. The effects of resilience from transgenerational inheritance have not been studied, but should be, for a full understanding not only of the disease risk across generations, but also of its social and cultural implications. The epigenetic pathologic effects across generations also need further studies, as the current research is preliminary; larger replications are needed for definitive and more complete understanding. I present here a glimpse of where we are, a vision of where we should go in terms of future research direction for disease risk transmission, and recommend studies of resilience and post-traumatic growth across generations, as well as other studies related to the societal implications at the population level.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine
"The Effects of Trauma, with or without PTSD, on the Transgenerational DNA Methylation Alterations in Human Offsprings.","Exposure to psychological trauma is a strong risk factor for several debilitating disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Besides the impact on mental well-being and behavior in the exposed individuals, it has been suggested that psychological trauma can affect the biology of the individuals, and even have biological and behavioral consequences on the offspring of exposed individuals. While knowledge of possible epigenetic underpinnings of the association between exposure to trauma and risk of PTSD has been discussed in several reviews, it remains to be established whether trauma-induced epigenetic modifications can be passed from traumatized individuals to subsequent generations of offspring. The aim of this paper is to review the emerging literature on evidence of transgenerational inheritance due to trauma exposure on the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation in humans. Our review found an accumulating amount of evidence of an enduring effect of trauma exposure to be passed to offspring transgenerationally via the epigenetic inheritance mechanism of DNA methylation alterations and has the capacity to change the expression of genes and the metabolome. This manuscript summarizes and critically reviews the relevant original human studies in this area. Thus, it provides an overview of where we stand, and a clearer vision of where we should go in terms of future research directions.",Brain sciences

Experiences of Trauma and DNA Methylation Profiles among African American Mothers and Children.,"Potentially traumatic experiences have been associated with chronic diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as an explanation for this association. We examined the association of experiences of trauma with epigenome-wide DNAm among African American mothers (<i>n</i> = 236) and their children aged 3-5 years (<i>n</i> = 232; N = 500), using the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC) and Traumatic Events Screening Inventory-Parent Report Revised (TESI-PRR). We identified no DNAm sites significantly associated with potentially traumatic experience scores in mothers. One CpG site on the <i>ENOX1</i> gene was methylome-wide-significant in children (FDR-corrected q-value = 0.05) from the TESI-PRR. This protein-coding gene is associated with mental illness, including unipolar depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Future research should further examine the associations between childhood trauma, DNAm, and health outcomes among this understudied and high-risk group. Findings from such longitudinal research may inform clinical and translational approaches to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with epigenetic changes.",International journal of molecular sciences
Gene-based mediation analysis in epigenetic studies.,"Mediation analysis has been a useful tool for investigating the effect of mediators that lie in the path from the independent variable to the outcome. With the increasing dimensionality of mediators such as in (epi)genomics studies, high-dimensional mediation model is needed. In this work, we focus on epigenetic studies with the goal to identify important DNA methylations that act as mediators between an exposure disease outcome. Specifically, we focus on gene-based high-dimensional mediation analysis implemented with kernel principal component analysis to capture potential nonlinear mediation effect. We first review the current high-dimensional mediation models and then propose two gene-based analytical approaches: gene-based high-dimensional mediation analysis based on linearity assumption between mediators and outcome (gHMA-L) and gene-based high-dimensional mediation analysis based on nonlinearity assumption (gHMA-NL). Since the underlying true mediation relationship is unknown in practice, we further propose an omnibus test of gene-based high-dimensional mediation analysis (gHMA-O) by combing gHMA-L and gHMA-NL. Extensive simulation studies show that gHMA-L performs better under the model linear assumption and gHMA-NL does better under the model nonlinear assumption, while gHMA-O is a more powerful and robust method by combining the two. We apply the proposed methods to two datasets to investigate genes whose methylation levels act as important mediators in the relationship: (1) between alcohol consumption and epithelial ovarian cancer risk using data from the Mayo Clinic Ovarian Cancer Case-Control Study and (2) between childhood maltreatment and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in adulthood using data from the Gray Trauma Project.",Briefings in bioinformatics
Role of MicroRNAs in Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Disorders.,"MicroRNAs as critical regulators of gene expression important for functions including neuronal development, synapse formation, and synaptic plasticity have been linked with the regulation of neurobiological systems that underlie anxiety processing in the brain. In this chapter, we give an update on associative evidence linking regulation of microRNAs with anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. Moving beyond correlative research, functional studies have emerged recently that explore causal relationships between microRNA expression and anxiety-like behavior. It has been demonstrated that experimental up- or downregulation of the candidate microRNAs in important nodes of the anxiety neurocircuitry can indeed modulate anxiety-related behavior in animal models. Improved methodologies for assessing microRNA-mediated modulation have aided such functional studies, revealing a number of anxiety-regulating microRNAs including miR-15a, miR-17-92, miR-34, miR-101, miR-124, miR-135, and miR-155. Important functional target genes of these identified microRNAs are associated with specific neurotransmitter/neuromodulator signaling, neurotrophin (e.g., BDNF) expression and other aspects of synaptic plasticity, as well as with stress-regulatory/hypothalamic-pituitary-axis function. Furthermore, microRNAs have been revealed that are regulated in distinct brain regions following various anxiety-attenuating strategies. These include pharmacological treatments such as antidepressants and other drugs, as well as non-pharmacological interventions such as fear extinction/exposure therapy or positive stimuli such as exposure to environmental enrichment. These are first indications for a role for microRNAs in the mechanism of action of anxiolytic treatments. As research continues, there is much hope that a deeper understanding of the microRNA-mediated mechanisms underlying anxiety-related disorders could open up possibilities for future novel biomarker and treatment strategies.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences
Oxytocin receptor DNA methylation in postpartum depression.,"The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) is a key regulator of stress and anxiety and may be regulated by both psychosocial risk factors and gonadal hormones, making it an attractive candidate for study in postpartum depression (PPD). The objective of this study was to investigate both serum hormone and PPD specific DNA methylation variation in the OXTR. Illumina HM450 microarray data generated in a prospective PPD cohort identified significant associations (P=0.014) with PPD in an intronic region in the OXTR located 4bp proximal to an estrogen receptor (ER) binding region. Pyrosequencing confirmed moderate evidence for an interaction of CpGs in the region with childhood abuse status to mediate PPD. These CpGs located on chr3 at positions 8810078 and 8810069 exhibited significant associations with postpartum depression scores from an independent cohort of 240 women with no prior psychiatric history. Hormone analysis suggested a PPD specific negative correlation of DNA methylation in the region with serum estradiol levels. Estradiol levels and OXTR DNA methylation exhibited a significant interaction to associate with the ratio of allopregnanolone to progesterone. Cumulatively, the data corroborate our previous hypotheses of a PPD specific increased sensitivity of epigenetic reprogramming at estrogen target genes and suggests that OXTR epigenetic variation may be an important mediator of mood relevant neuroactive steroid production.",Psychoneuroendocrinology
Childhood trauma in mood disorders: Neurobiological mechanisms and implications for treatment.,"A contemporary model for the pathogenesis of mood disorders (bipolar and depressive disorders) involves gene-environmental interaction, with genetic predisposition, epigenetic regulation, and environmental effects. Among multiple environmental factors, the experience of childhood trauma can be connected with the pathogenesis, course and the treatment of mood disorders. Patients with mood disorders have the greater frequency of childhood trauma compared with the general population, and adverse childhood experiences can exert a negative impact on their clinical course. In this article, the neurobiological mechanisms of childhood trauma are presented. The influence of negative childhood experiences on the central nervous system can result in many structural and functional changes of the brain, including such structures as hippocampus and amygdala, associated with the development of bipolar and depressive illnesses. Interaction of several genes with childhood trauma to produce pathological, clinical phenomena in adulthood has been demonstrated, the most important in this respect being the serotonin transporter gene and the FKBP5 gene playing an important role in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Neurobiological effects can also involve epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation which can exert an effect on brain function over long-term periods. Somatic effects of childhood trauma include disturbances of stress axis and immune-inflammatory mechanisms as well as metabolic dysregulation. Negative childhood experiences may also bear implications for the treatment of mood disorders. In the article, the impact of such experiences on the treatment of mood disorders will be discussed, especially in the context of treatment -resistance to antidepressants and mood-stabilizing drugs.",Pharmacological reports : PR

Intergenerational trauma is associated with expression alterations in glucocorticoid- and immune-related genes.,"Offspring of trauma survivors are more likely to develop PTSD, mood, and anxiety disorders and demonstrate endocrine and molecular alterations compared to controls. This study reports the association between parental Holocaust exposure and genome-wide gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 77 Holocaust survivor offspring and 15 comparison subjects. Forty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in association with parental Holocaust exposure (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05); most of these genes were downregulated and co-expressed in a gene network related to immune cell functions. When both parental Holocaust exposure and maternal age at Holocaust exposure shared DEGs, fold changes were in the opposite direction. Similarly, fold changes of shared DEGs associated with maternal PTSD and paternal PTSD were in opposite directions, while fold changes of shared DEGs associated with both maternal and paternal Holocaust exposure or associated with both maternal and paternal age at Holocaust exposure were in the same direction. Moreover, the DEGs associated with parental Holocaust exposure were enriched for glucocorticoid-regulated genes and immune pathways with some of these genes mediating the effects of parental Holocaust exposure on C-reactive protein. The top gene across all analyses was MMP8, encoding the matrix metalloproteinase 8, which is a regulator of innate immunity. To conclude, this study identified a set of glucocorticoid and immune-related genes in association with parental Holocaust exposure with differential effects based on parental exposure-related factors.",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology
The role of DNA methylation in stress-related psychiatric disorders.,"Epigenetic modifications in response to traumatic experience and stress are emerging as important factors in the long-term biological trajectories leading to stress-related psychiatric disorders, reflecting both environmental influences as well as individual genetic predisposition. In particular, recent evidence on DNA methylation changes within distinct genes and pathways but also on a genome-wide level provides new insights into the pathophysiology of stress related psychiatric disorders. This review summarizes current findings and concepts on DNA methylation changes in stress-related disorders with a focus on major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We highlight studies of DNA methylation in animals and humans pertinent to these disorders, both focusing on candidate loci as well as genome-wide studies. We describe molecular mechanisms of how exposure to stress can induce long lasting changes in DNA methylation and how these may relate to the pathophysiology of depression and PTSD. We discuss data suggesting that DNA methylation, even in peripheral tissues, appears to be an informative reflection of environmental exposures on the genome and may have potential as a biomarker for the early prevention of stress-related disorders.",Neuropharmacology

DNA methylation of IL-4 gene and the association with childhood trauma in panic disorder.,"Increasing evidence suggests that aberrations in the immune-inflammatory pathways contribute to the pathophysiology of panic disorder (PD). We aimed to investigate whether an aberrant DNA methylation of the inflammation-related genes in the development of PD, including CCL3, CRP, CSF2, CXCL8, IFNG, IL12B, IL1A, IL-4, IL-6, TNF. Then, the effect of childhood trauma(CT) on methylation levels of  inflammation-related genes and the severity of PD was also investigated. We compared the methylation levels of the inflammation-related genes between 113 patients with PD and 130 matched healthy controls using MethylTarget approach. In addition, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-28 item Short Form (CTQ-28) were respectively assessed to all subjects. The result found that the methylation levels of IL-4 gene was significantly higher in PD patients than controls. ROC results found that the IL-4 gene had a sensitivity of 52.3% and a specificity of 74.6%. The methylation levels of IL-4 gene was significantly positively related to the severity of panic and anxiety. Finally, the hypermethylation of CSF2, CXCL8 and IL-4 genes was significantly associated with higher CT.",Psychiatry research
PTSD is associated with increased DNA methylation across regions of HLA-DPB1 and SPATC1L.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by intrusive thoughts, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and arousal symptoms that adversely affect mental and physical health. Recent evidence links changes in DNA methylation of CpG cites to PTSD. Since clusters of proximal CpGs share similar methylation signatures, identification of PTSD-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) may elucidate the pathways defining differential risk and resilience of PTSD. Here we aimed to identify epigenetic differences associated with PTSD. DNA methylation data profiled from blood samples using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip were used to perform a DMR analysis in 187 PTSD cases and 367 trauma-exposed controls from the Grady Trauma Project (GTP). DMRs were assessed with R package bumphunter. We identified two regions that associate with PTSD after multiple test correction. These regions were in the gene body of HLA-DPB1 and in the promoter of SPATC1L. The DMR in HLA-DPB1 was associated with PTSD in an independent cohort. Both DMRs included CpGs whose methylation associated with nearby sequence variation (meQTL) and that associated with expression of their respective genes (eQTM). This study supports an emerging literature linking PTSD risk to genetic and epigenetic variation in the HLA region.","Brain, behavior, and immunity"
DNA methylation from germline cells in veterans with PTSD.,"In this study we investigated genome-wide sperm DNA methylation patterns in trauma-exposed Vietnam veterans. At the genome-wide level, we identified 3 CpG sites associated with PTSD in sperm including two intergenic and one CpG within the CCDC88C gene. Of those associated with PTSD in sperm at a nominal level, 1868 CpGs were also associated with PTSD in peripheral blood (5.6% overlap) including the RORA, CRHR1 and DOCK2 genes that have been previously implicated in PTSD. A total of 10 CpG sites were significantly associated with a reported history of a diagnosed mental health condition in children and reached genome-wide significance. CpGs associated with a history of a reported mental health condition in children were also enriched (90% of tested genes) for genes previously reported to be resistant to demethylation, making them strong candidates for transgenerational inheritance. In conclusion, our findings identify a unique sperm-specific DNA methylation pattern that is associated with PTSD.",Journal of psychiatric research
Genomic Approaches to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: The Psychiatric Genomic Consortium Initiative.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after exposure to a traumatic event is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder. Heritability estimates from twin studies as well as from recent molecular data (single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability) indicate moderate to high heritability, yet robust genetic variants for PTSD have not yet been identified and the genetic architecture of this polygenic disorder remains largely unknown. To date, fewer than 10 large-scale genome-wide association studies of PTSD have been published, with findings that highlight the unique challenges for PTSD genomics, including a complex diagnostic entity with contingency of PTSD diagnosis on trauma exposure and the large genetic diversity of the study populations. The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium PTSD group has brought together more than 200 scientists with the goal to increase sample size for genome-wide association studies and other genomic analyses to sufficient numbers where robust discoveries of molecular signatures can be achieved. The sample currently includes more than 32,000 PTSD cases and 100,000 trauma-exposed control subjects, and collection is ongoing. The first results found a significant shared genetic risk of PTSD with other psychiatric disorders and sex-biased heritability estimates with higher heritability in female individuals compared with male individuals. This review describes the scope and current focus of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium PTSD group and its expansion from the initial genome-wide association study group to nine working groups, including epigenetics, gene expression, imaging, and integrative systems biology. We further briefly outline recent findings and future directions of ""omics""-based studies of PTSD, with the ultimate goal of elucidating the molecular architecture of this complex disorder to improve prevention and intervention strategies.",Biological psychiatry
Patho-genetics of posttraumatic stress disorder.,"Clinical genetic studies propose a moderate genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of PTSD with a heritability of about 30-35%. The present brief review will give an overview of molecular genetic research in PTSD yielding support for specific vulnerability genes. Additionally, evidence for gene-environment (GxE) interactions between susceptibility genes of PTSD and traumatic experiences will be reported. Recent studies suggest a pivotal role of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation in mediating the impact of trauma in the pathogenesis of PTSD. Future approaches to further unravel the genetic underpinnings of PTSD might comprise genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the investigation of the genetic influence on intermediate phenotypes of PTSD (e.g., imaging genetics) as well as pharmaco- and psychotherapy-genetic studies. Genetic research in PTSD will be discussed with respect to its potential benefit regarding innovative and individually tailored therapeutic approaches in PTSD.",Psychiatria Danubina
Early-life trauma endophenotypes and brain circuit-gene expression relationships in functional neurological (conversion) disorder.,"Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a neuropsychiatric condition whereby individuals present with sensorimotor symptoms incompatible with other neurological disorders. Early-life maltreatment (ELM) is a risk factor for developing FND, yet few studies have investigated brain network-trauma relationships in this population. In this neuroimaging-gene expression study, we used two graph theory approaches to elucidate ELM subtype effects on resting-state functional connectivity architecture in 30 patients with motor FND. Twenty-one individuals with comparable depression, anxiety, and ELM scores were used as psychiatric controls. Thereafter, we compared trauma endophenotypes in FND with regional differences in transcriptional gene expression as measured by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). In FND patients only, we found that early-life physical abuse severity, and to a lesser extent physical neglect, correlated with corticolimbic weighted-degree functional connectivity. Connectivity profiles influenced by physical abuse occurred in limbic (amygdalar-hippocampal), paralimbic (cingulo-insular and ventromedial prefrontal), and cognitive control (ventrolateral prefrontal) areas, as well as in sensorimotor and visual cortices. These findings held adjusting for individual differences in depression/anxiety, PTSD, and motor phenotypes. In FND, physical abuse also correlated with amygdala and insula coupling to motor cortices. In exploratory analyses, physical abuse correlated connectivity maps overlapped with the AHBA spatial expression of three gene clusters: (i) neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission genes in limbic/paralimbic areas; (ii) locomotory behavior and neuronal generation genes in left-lateralized structures; and (iii) nervous system development and cell motility genes in right-lateralized structures. These circuit-specific architectural profiles related to individual differences in childhood physical abuse burden advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of FND.",Molecular psychiatry
Can epigenetics shine a light on the biological pathways underlying major mental disorders?,"A significant proportion of the global burden of disease can be attributed to mental illness. Despite important advances in identifying risk factors for mental health conditions, the biological processing underlying causal pathways to disease onset remain poorly understood. This represents a limitation to implement effective prevention and the development of novel pharmacological treatments. Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as mediators of environmental and genetic risk factors which might play a role in disease onset, including childhood adversity (CA) and cannabis use (CU). Particularly, human research exploring DNA methylation has provided new and promising insights into the role of biological pathways implicated in the aetio-pathogenesis of psychiatric conditions, including: monoaminergic (Serotonin and Dopamine), GABAergic, glutamatergic, neurogenesis, inflammatory and immune response and oxidative stress. While these epigenetic changes have been often studied as disease-specific, similarly to the investigation of environmental risk factors, they are often transdiagnostic. Therefore, we aim to review the existing literature on DNA methylation from human studies of psychiatric diseases (i) to identify epigenetic modifications mapping onto biological pathways either transdiagnostically or specifically related to psychiatric diseases such as Eating Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Bipolar and Psychotic Disorder, Depression, Autism Spectrum Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, and (ii) to investigate a convergence between some of these epigenetic modifications and the exposure to known risk factors for psychiatric disorders such as CA and CU, as well as to other epigenetic confounders in psychiatry research.",Psychological medicine
Intergenerational Transmission of DNA Methylation Signatures Associated with Early Life Stress.,"Early life stress in humans (i.e. maltreatment, violence exposure, loss of a loved one) and in rodents (i.e. disrupted attachment or nesting, electric shock, restraint, predator odor) occurs during critical steps of neural circuit formation. ELS in humans is associated with increased risk for developmental psychopathology, including anxious and depressive phenotypes. The biological mechanisms underlying these potentially persistent maladaptive changes involve long-term epigenetic modifications, which have been suggested to be potentially transmissible to subsequent generations. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that modifies gene expression patterns in response to environmental challenges and influences mutation rates. It remains to be seen whether a functionally relevant fraction of DNA methylation marks can escape genome-wide erasures that occur in primordial germ cells and after fertilization within the zygote. Early life-stress-triggered changes in epigenetic mediated transmission of acquired behavioral traits among humans have been assessed mainly by targeting genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, such as NR3C1 and FKBP5. Recently, researchers examining epigenetic transmission have begun to apply genome-wide approaches. In humans, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on peripheral samples that were obtained from individuals who were prenatally exposed to the ""Dutch Hunger Winter"", resulting in two Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) in INSR and CPTIA genes that were functionally, biologically and technically validated, and significantly associated with birth weights and LDL cholesterol levels in offspring. In rodents, non-genomic intergenerational transmission of anxiety which was associated with differentially methylated enhancers that were putatively involved in lipid signaling and synaptic/neurotransmission in hippocampal granule cells, was discovered also using RRBS. Finally, transgenerational transmission of altered behaviors was associated with sperm-derived microRNAs produced by ELS male mice. The field of epigenetic transmission is just beginning to enter the epigenomic era by using genome-wide analyses. Such approaches remain of strong interest to human studies, first in order to help to assess the relevance of the previous targeted studies, and second to discover new important epigenetic modifications of potential clinical importance. New discoveries may help to assess how transmittable the negative impact of stress may be to offspring. The latter may open doors for future treatments and resilience-promoting interventions, as well as new approaches to treat the effects of childhood trauma before the onset of psychiatric disorder.",Current genomics
Understanding posttraumatic stress disorder: insights from the methylome.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous disease-associated variants; however, these variants have a minor effect on disease and explain only a small amount of the heritability of complex disorders. The search for the missing heritability has shifted attention to rare variants, copy number variants, copy neutral variants and epigenetic modifications. The central role of epigenetics, and specifically DNA methylation, in disease susceptibility and progression has become more apparent in recent years. Epigenetic mechanisms facilitate the response to environmental changes and challenges by regulating gene expression. This makes the study of DNA methylation in psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) highly salient, as the environment plays such a vital role in disease aetiology. The epigenome is dynamic and can be modulated by numerous factors, including learning and memory, which are important in the context of PTSD. Numerous studies have shown the effects of early life events, such as maternal separation and traumas during adulthood, on DNA methylation patterns and subsequent gene expression profiles. Aberrations in adaptive DNA methylation contribute to disease susceptibility when an organism is unable to effectively respond to environmental demands. Epigenetic mechanisms are also involved in higher order brain functions. Dysregulation of methylation is associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative cognitive disorders, affective disorders, addictive behaviours and altered stress responses. A thorough understanding of how the environment, methylome and transcriptome interact and influence each other in the context of fear and anxiety is integral to our understanding and treatment of stress-related disorders such as PTSD.","Genes, brain, and behavior"
DNA methylation changes in association with trauma-focused psychotherapy efficacy in treatment-resistant depression patients: a prospective longitudinal study.,"<b>Background</b>: Stressful events increase the risk for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and trauma-focused psychotherapy can be useful for TRD patients exposed to early life stress (ELS). Epigenetic processes are known to be related to depression and ELS, but there is no evidence of the effects of trauma-focused psychotherapy on methylation alterations.<b>Objective</b>: We performed the first epigenome-wide association study to investigate methylation changes related to trauma-focused psychotherapies effects in TRD patients.<b>Method</b>: Thirty TRD patients assessed for ELS underwent trauma-focused psychotherapy, of those, 12 received trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, and 18 Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). DNA methylation was profiled with Illumina Infinium EPIC array at T0 (baseline), after 8 weeks (T8, end of psychotherapy) and after 12 weeks (T12 - follow-up). We examined differentially methylated CpG sites and regions, as well as pathways analysis in association with the treatment.<b>Results</b>: Main results obtained have shown 110 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with a significant adjusted <i>p</i>-value area associated with the effects of trauma-focused psychotherapies in the entire cohort. Several annotated genes are related to inflammatory processes and psychiatric disorders, such as <i>LTA</i>, <i>GFI1</i>, <i>ARID5B</i>, <i>TNFSF13,</i> and <i>LST1.</i> Gene enrichment analyses revealed statistically significant processes related to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and TNF signalling pathway. Stratified analyses by type of trauma-focused psychotherapy showed statistically significant adjusted <i>p</i>-value area in 141 DMRs only for the group of patients receiving EMDR, with annotated genes related to inflammation and psychiatric disorders, including <i>LTA, GFI1,</i> and <i>S100A8</i>. Gene set enrichment analyses in the EMDR group indicated biological processes related to inflammatory response, particularly the TNF signalling pathway.<b>Conclusion</b>: We provide preliminary valuable insights into global DNA methylation changes associated with trauma-focused psychotherapies effects, in particular with EMDR treatment.",European journal of psychotraumatology
Epigenomic Links Between Social Determinants of Health and Symptoms: A Scoping Review.,"Social determinants of health (SDoH) impact health and wellness. The link between SDoH and adverse health outcomes, including symptom occurrence and severity, may be explained by an individual's physiologic response to one or more SDoH. One potential mechanism underlying this physiologic response linking SDoH and symptoms is the dynamic epigenome. The purpose of this scoping review of the literature was to examine differential susceptibility for symptoms by identifying and summarizing research linking SDoH and symptoms through epigenomic mechanisms. PubMed was searched to identify empirical research where at least one SDoH was an independent or dependent variable, at least one symptom was investigated, and the investigation included an epigenomic measure. Of the 484 articles initially retrieved, after thorough vetting, 41 articles met eligibility. The most studied symptom was depressive symptoms followed by anxiety, cognitive function, sleep dysfunction, and pain. The most frequently studied SDoH were: 1) stress, particularly early life stress and acculturative stress; and 2) trauma, predominantly childhood trauma. DNA methylation and telomere length were the most studied epigenomic measures. Four genes (<i>SLC6A4, BDNF, NR3C1, OXTR</i>) had evidence from multiple studies and across methodological approaches linking SDoH to symptoms. This review supports the inclusion of epigenomic approaches to better understand the link between SDoH and symptoms and provides evidence that SDoH impact telomere length and the methylation of genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, neuronal survival, behavior, inflammation and stress response.",Biological research for nursing
Childhood maltreatment and monocyte gene expression among women with breast cancer.,"Childhood adversity is reliably associated with immune alterations in adulthood, including increases in inflammatory processes.

Biological underpinnings of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder: focusing on genetics and epigenetics.,"Certain individuals are more susceptible to stress and trauma, as well as the physical and mental health consequences following such exposure, including risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This differing vulnerability is likely to be influenced by genetic predisposition and specific characteristics of the stress itself (nature, intensity and duration), as well as epigenetic mechanisms. In this review we provide an overview of research findings in this field. We highlight some of the key genetic risk factors identified for PTSD, and the evidence that epigenetic processes might play a role in the biological response to trauma, as well as being potential biomarkers of PTSD risk. We also discuss important considerations for future research in this area.",Epigenomics

Epigenetic programming of the neuroendocrine stress response by adult life stress.,"The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is critically involved in the neuroendocrine regulation of stress adaptation, and the restoration of homeostasis following stress exposure. Dysregulation of this axis is associated with stress-related pathologies like major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder and chronic anxiety. It has long been understood that stress during early life can have a significant lasting influence on the development of the neuroendocrine system and its neural regulators, partially by modifying epigenetic regulation of gene expression, with implications for health and well-being in later life. Evidence is accumulating that epigenetic plasticity also extends to adulthood, proposing it as a mechanism by which psychological trauma later in life can long-lastingly affect HPA axis function, brain plasticity, neuronal function and behavioural adaptation to neuropsychological stress. Further corroborating this claim is the phenomenon that these epigenetic changes correlate with the behavioural consequences of trauma exposure. Thereby, epigenetic modifications provide a putative molecular mechanism by which the behavioural phenotype and transcriptional/translational potential of genes involved in HPA axis regulation can change drastically in response to environmental challenges, and appear an important target for treatment of stress-related disorders. However, improved insight is required to increase their therapeutic (drug) potential. Here, we provide an overview of the growing body of literature describing the epigenetic modulation of the (primarily neuroendocrine) stress response as a consequence of adult life stress and interpret the implications for, and the challenges involved in applying this knowledge to, the identification and treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders.",Journal of molecular endocrinology

Epigenetic Contributors to PTSD: a Comprehensive Review.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex condition triggered by traumatic events. The molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD are not fully understood, but epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, may play a key role. The objective of this review was to identify the most significant epigenetic markers associated with PTSD.",Psychiatria Danubina
Epigenetics in posttraumatic stress disorder.,"Reported exposure to traumatic event is relatively common within the general population (40-90%), but only a fraction of individuals will develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD is estimated to range between 7% and 12%. The factors influencing risk or resilience to PTSD after exposure to traumatic events are likely both environmental, such as type, timing, and extent of trauma, and genetic. Recently, epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in mediating altered risk for PTSD as they can reflect both genetic and environmental influences. In this chapter, we describe the accumulating evidences for epigenetic factors in PTSD highlighting the importance of sensitive periods as well as methodological aspects such as tissue availabilities for such studies. We describe studies using a candidate gene approach focusing mainly on key players in the stress hormone regulation that show epigenetic alterations both in humans and in animal models for PTSD. We also summarize the results of epigenome-wide studies reporting associations with PTSD. For the above, we focus on one epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, as it is so far the best studied for this disorder. Finally, we describe how epigenetic mechanisms could be responsible for the long-lasting effects of gene-environment interactions observed in PTSD.",Progress in molecular biology and translational science
Epigenetic Aging in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder is associated with an increased risk of mortality and aging-related diseases. The authors examined whether major depression is associated with higher epigenetic aging in blood as measured by DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns, whether clinical characteristics of major depression have a further impact on these patterns, and whether the findings replicate in brain tissue.",The American journal of psychiatry
Accelerated DNA Methylation Age: Associations With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Mortality.,"Recently developed indices of cellular age based on DNA methylation (DNAm) data, referred to as DNAm age, are being used to study factors that influence the rate of aging and the health correlates of these metrics of the epigenetic clock. This study evaluated associations between trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and accelerated versus decelerated DNAm age among military veterans. We also examined whether accelerated DNAm age predicted mortality over the course of a 6.5-year medical record review period.",Psychosomatic medicine
A Role for Histone Deacetylases in the Biology and Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: What Do We Know and Where Do We Go from Here?,"Post-traumatic stress disorder is a prevalent disorder within the USA and worldwide with a yearly diagnosis rate of 2-4% and affecting women more than men. One of the primary methods for study of this stress disorder relies on animal models as there are few noninvasive methods and few replicated peripheral biomarkers for use in humans. One area of active research in psychiatric neuroscience is the field of epigenetics - how the chemical modifications of the genetic code regulate behavior. The dynamic changes in histone acetylation and deacetylation in the brain are not fully reflected by the study of peripheral biomarker. In this review, we aim to examine the role of histone acetylation and deacetylation in memory formation and fear memory learning. The studies discussed here focus largely on the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in animal models of trauma and fear response. Many studies used HDAC inhibitors to elucidate the effects after inhibition of these enzymes after trauma or stress. These studies of memory processing and cued fear extinction in animal can often shed light on human disorders of cued fear responses and memory dysregulation after stress or trauma such as in PTSD. These results provide strong evidence for a role of these enzymes in PTSD in humans. The few clinical studies that exist with HDAC inhibitors also suggest a fundamental role of these enzymes in the neurobiology of the stress response. Further study of these enzymes in both clinical and pre-clinical settings may help elucidate the neurobiology of stress-related pathology like PTSD and provide a foundation for novel therapy to treat these disorders.",Complex psychiatry
"Childhood Trauma, DNA Methylation of Stress-Related Genes, and Depression: Findings From Two Monozygotic Twin Studies.",DNA methylation has been associated with both early life stress and depression.

Oxytocin receptor gene methylation in male and female PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls.,"Oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) DNA-methylation levels have been associated with trauma-exposure, mood- and anxiety disorders, and social processes relevant to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that OXTR methylation may play a role in the neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD. In the current study, we compared OXTR methylation between PTSD patients (n = 31, 14 females) and trauma-exposed controls (n = 36, 19 females). Additionally, the association between OXTR methylation and PTSD symptom severity and amygdala reactivity to an emotional faces task was assessed, as a neural hallmark of PTSD. DNA-methylation was investigated in the CpG island located at exon 3 of the OXTR, previously associated with OXTR expression. We observed a significant interaction between PTSD-status, sex and CpG-position on methylation levels. Post-hoc testing revealed that methylation levels at two specific CpG-sites were significantly higher in PTSD females compared to female trauma-exposed controls and PTSD males (CpGs Chr3:8809437, Chr3:8809413). No significant differences in methylation were observed between male PTSD patients and controls. Furthermore, within PTSD females, methylation in these CpG-sites was positively associated with anhedonia symptoms and with left amygdala responses to negative emotional faces, although this was no longer significant after stringent correction for multiple-comparisons. Though the modest size of the current sample is an important limitation, we are the first to report on OXTR methylation in PTSD, replicating previously observed (sex-specific) associations of OXTR methylation with other psychiatric disorders.",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology
No association between war-related trauma or PTSD symptom severity and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in Burundian refugees.,"<b>Background:</b> War-related trauma is associated with varying posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence rates in refugees. In PTSD development, differential DNA methylation (DNAm) levels associated with trauma exposure might be involved in risk versus resilience processes. Studies investigating DNAm profiles related to trauma exposure and PTSD among refugees remain sparse.<b>Objective:</b> The present epigenome-wide association study investigated associations between war-related trauma, PTSD, and altered DNAm patterns in Burundian refugee families with 110 children and their 207 female and male caregivers.<b>Method:</b> War-related trauma load and PTSD symptom severity were assessed in structured clinical interviews with standardised instruments. Epigenome-wide DNAm levels were quantified from buccal epithelia using the Illumina EPIC beadchip.<b>Results:</b> Controlling for biological confounders, no significant epigenome-wide DNAm alterations associated with trauma exposure or PTSD were identified in children or caregivers (<i>FDRs </i>> .05). Co-methylated positions derived as modules from weighted gene correlation network analyses were not significantly associated with either war-related trauma experience in children or caregivers or with PTSD.<b>Conclusions:</b> These results do not provide evidence for altered DNAm patterns associated with exposure to war-related trauma or PTSD.",European journal of psychotraumatology
"Childhood trauma, suicide risk and inflammatory phenotypes of depression: insights from monocyte gene expression.","Circulating monocytes contribute to inflammatory processes. We here validate abnormal expression of inflammation-related genes in monocytes of a large and well-characterised group of MDD patients, and relate the outcomes to pertinent clinical characteristics. Thirty-two genes of a previously established inflammation-related gene signature were assessed in 197 patients with MDD, and 151 controls collected during the EU-MOODINFLAME project. Monocyte gene- expression data were related to age, sex, BMI, depression severity, childhood adversity (CA) and suicide risk (SR). Three distinct gene profiles were identified within the MDD group (downregulated, mixed upregulated and strongly upregulated genes). Patients in the merged upregulated groups had a significantly higher prevalence of CA and high SR. Using hierarchical clustering of the genes, we found a cluster of mainly cytokine (production)-related genes; patients with SR had a significantly higher expression of this cluster than patients without SR (particularly for IL-6, IL1A and IL1B). Such difference did not emerge for patients with and without CA. A downregulated gene profile was found for patients not exposed to CA and without SR (particularly for glucocorticoid-signalling genes NR3C1a and HSPA1/B). No inflammatory changes were observed for healthy controls exposed to CA. Our data show that inflammatory activation in MDD is not uniform, and that immunologically discernible phenotypes of depression can be linked to CA and high SR. The absence of monocyte inflammatory activation in healthy controls exposed to CA suggests an inflammatory involvement in MDD-prone individuals exposed to early stressors, but not healthy controls.",Translational psychiatry
DNA methylation signatures of childhood trauma predict psychiatric disorders and other adverse outcomes 17 years after exposure.,"Childhood trauma is robustly linked to a broad range of adverse outcomes with consequences persisting far into adulthood. We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to predict psychiatric disorders and other adverse outcomes from trauma-related methylation changes 16.9 years after trauma exposure in childhood. Methylation was assayed using a sequencing-based approach that provides near-complete coverage of all 28 million sites in the blood methylome. Methylation data involved 673 assays from 489 participants aged 13.6 years (SD = 1.9) with outcomes measures collected at age 30.4 (SD = 2.26). For a subset of 303 participants we also generated methylation data in adulthood. Trauma-related methylation risk scores (MRSs) significantly predicted adult depression, externalizing problems, nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorder, serious medical problems, social problems and poverty. The predictive power of the MRSs was higher than that of reported trauma and could not be explained by the reported trauma, correlations with demographic variables, or a continuity of the predicted health problems from childhood to adulthood. Rather than measuring the occurrence of traumatic events, the MRSs seemed to capture the subject-specific impact of trauma. The majority of predictive sites did not remain associated with the outcomes suggesting the signatures of trauma do not become biologically embedded in the blood methylome. Instead, the long-term effects of trauma therefore seemed more consistent with a developmental mechanism where the initial subject-specific impacts of trauma are magnified over time. The MRSs have the potential to be a novel clinical biomarker for the assessment of trauma-related health risks.",Molecular psychiatry
Evidence to Support the Use of S-Adenosylmethionine for Treatment of Post-Concussive Sequelae in the Military.,"Since the year 2000, over 413,000 service members have sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may present with post-concussive sequelae including headaches, fatigue, irritability, cognitive problems, depression, insomnia, and chronic pain. Although the focus of the article is on military TBI, the usefulness of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) would extend to both civilian and military populations. This narrative review examines the preclinical and clinical literature of SAMe's metabolism and alterations seen in disease states such as depressive disorders, pain disorders, fatigue, cognition, dementia, use in pregnancy and peripartum, children, adolescents, and adults, to the elderly with and without dementia, stroke, and neurodegeneration, in order to highlight its potential benefit in post-concussive sequelae after TBI.",Military medicine
Changes in Gene Expression and Neuroinflammation in the Hippocampus after Focal Brain Ischemia: Involvement in the Long-Term Cognitive and Mental Disorders.,"Ischemic brain injuries are accompanied by the long-term changes in gene expression in the hippocampus, the limbic system structure, involved in the regulation of key aspects of the higher nervous activity, such as cognitive functions and emotions. The altered expression of genes and proteins encoded by them may be related to the development of post-ischemic psycho-emotional and cognitive disturbances. Activation of neuroinflammation following stroke in the hippocampus has been suggested to play an essential role in induction of long-lasting consequences. Identification of changes in the gene expression patterns after ischemia and investigation of the dynamics of these changes in the hippocampus are the necessary first steps toward understanding molecular pathways responsible for the development of post-stroke cognitive impairments and mental pathologies.",Biochemistry.

"Alcohol consumption, depression, overweight and cortisol levels as determining factors for NR3C1 gene methylation.","The NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene is a component of the stress response system, which can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. NR3C1 methylation has been associated with trauma and mental issues, including depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and personality disorders. Previous studies have reported that stressful events are involved in NR3C1 gene methylation, suggesting that its regulation under environmental effects is complex. The present study aimed to analyze associations involving stressors such as socioeconomic status, health conditions, and lifestyle in relation to NR3C1 methylation in adults. This study included 386 individual users of the Brazilian Public Unified Health System (SUS), and evaluated socioeconomic and health conditions, body mass index, cortisol levels, and lifestyle. Data were correlated with NR3C1 methylation, determined using DNA pyrosequencing. The results showed that alcohol consumption, overweight, and high cortisol levels were related to NR3C1 demethylation, while depression was related to its methylation. Habits, lifestyle, and health status may influence NR3C1 gene regulation via methylation, revealing the complexity of environmental impacts on NR3C1 methylation.",Scientific reports
Mechanisms of Epigenetic Inheritance in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that causes debilitating functional impairment in patients. Observations from survivors of traumatic historical events solidify that this disease is not only associated with personal experiences but can also be inherited from familial traumas. Over the past decades, researchers have focused on epigenetic inheritance to understand how responses to adverse experiences can be passed down to future generations. This review aims to present recent findings on epigenetic markers related to PTSD and research in the intergenerational inheritance of trauma. By understanding the information, we hope that epigenetic markers can act as biochemical measurements for future clinical practice.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)"
"Adverse Childhood Experience, Genes, and PTSD Risk in Soldiers: A Methylation Study.","Epigenetics can serve as a marker of susceptibility to many known psychiatric diseases. DNA methylation patterns of multiple genes have been studied in both civilian populations and military personnel with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many of these genes serve various functions that span the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, immune system, and central nervous system (CNS) growth factors and neurotransmission. It is thought that the methylation levels of such genes may be able to identify individuals who are at higher risk of developing PTSD. Our study seeks to establish whether previously reported PTSD genes possess a particular methylation pattern that is predictive of PTSD in active duty military members with combat exposure.",Military medicine
Impaired cortical neuronal homeostasis and cognition after diffuse traumatic brain injury are dependent on microglia and type I interferon responses.,"Neuropsychiatric complications including depression and cognitive decline develop in the years after traumatic brain injury (TBI), negatively affecting quality of life. Microglial and type 1 interferon (IFN-I) responses are associated with the transition from acute to chronic neuroinflammation after diffuse TBI in mice. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if impaired neuronal homeostasis and increased IFN-I responses intersected after TBI to cause cognitive impairment. Here, the RNA profile of neurons and microglia after TBI (single nucleus RNA-sequencing) with or without microglia depletion (CSF1R antagonist) was assessed 7 dpi. There was a TBI-dependent suppression of cortical neuronal homeostasis with reductions in CREB signaling, synaptogenesis, and synaptic migration and increases in RhoGDI and PTEN signaling (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). Microglial depletion reversed 50% of TBI-induced gene changes in cortical neurons depending on subtype. Moreover, the microglial RNA signature 7 dpi was associated with increased stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation and IFN-I responses. Therefore, we sought to reduce IFN-I signaling after TBI using STING knockout mice and a STING antagonist, chloroquine (CQ). TBI-associated cognitive deficits in novel object location and recognition (NOL/NOR) tasks at 7 and 30 dpi were STING dependent. In addition, TBI-induced STING expression, microglial morphological restructuring, inflammatory (Tnf, Cd68, Ccl2) and IFN-related (Irf3, Irf7, Ifi27) gene expression in the cortex were attenuated in STING<sup>KO</sup> mice. CQ also reversed TBI-induced cognitive deficits and reduced TBI-induced inflammatory (Tnf, Cd68, Ccl2) and IFN (Irf7, Sting) cortical gene expression. Collectively, reducing IFN-I signaling after TBI with STING-dependent interventions attenuated the prolonged microglial activation and cognitive impairment.",Glia
The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior.,"Suicidal behaviour is a major public health concern. It is known that the pathogenesis of suicidal behaviour involves altered neural plasticity, resulting in the aberrant stress response of the central nervous system to environmental factors. Indeed, altered brain structure and function was found in suicide victims. Neurotrophins are growth factors that are involved in the regulation of structural, synaptic, and morphological plasticity and in the modulation of the strength and number of synaptic connections and neurotransmission. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) the most studied and the most widely distributed among neurotrophins binds to a tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor and to a pan75 neurotrophins receptor. It has been reported that BDNF production is decreased in all patients with suicidal behaviour and in all suicide victims regardless of a psychiatric diagnosis. It was also found that the mRNA and protein level of BDNF was significantly lower in both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of suicide subjects. Different mechanisms could be involved in the regulation of BDNF gene expression, among which epigenetic mechanisms seem to play a key role. However, also for a functional polymorphism (rs6265) Val66Metit has been shown that the Met allele is associated with the reduced BDNF activity. Further, a recent meta-analysis including 12 studies showed a trend for the Met-carrying genotypes and Met allele conferring risk for suicide. Among included studies, our study with the largest sample size, indicated that the combined Met/Met and Met/Val genotypes of the BDNF Val66Met variant could be the risk factor for violent suicide in female subjects and for suicide in victims exposed to childhood trauma. In accordance with previous reports, our findings demonstrate that aberrant regulation of BDNF synthesis is associated with suicidal behaviour.",Psychiatria Danubina

[Bipolar disorder: a multifactorial disease].,"Bipolar disorder is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. However, environmental factors also play a role in the onset of the disease and in manic and depressive recurrence. The onset of the disorder is the consequence of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. This gene-environment interaction is well illustrated by the influence of childhood trauma on the clinical expression of the disease in terms of age of onset, comorbidity and suicide. The complexity and heterogeneity of bipolar disorder require the identification of homogenous sub-groups with the use of biomarkers that could help reduce the etiological heterogeneity and better target the therapeutical options.",Revue medicale de Liege
Evaluating the impact of trauma and PTSD on epigenetic prediction of lifespan and neural integrity.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that develops in some people following trauma exposure. Trauma and PTSD have been associated with accelerated cellular aging. This study evaluated the effect of trauma and PTSD on accelerated GrimAge, an epigenetic predictor of lifespan, in traumatized civilians. This study included 218 individuals with current PTSD, 427 trauma-exposed controls without any history of PTSD and 209 subjects with lifetime PTSD history who are not categorized as current PTSD cases. The Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were used to measure lifetime trauma burden and PTSD, respectively. DNA from whole blood was interrogated using the MethylationEPIC or HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. GrimAge estimates were calculated using the methylation age calculator. Cortical thickness of 69 female subjects was assessed by using T1-weighted structural MRI images. Associations between trauma exposure, PTSD, cortical thickness, and GrimAge acceleration were tested with multiple regression models. Lifetime trauma burden (p = 0.03), current PTSD (p = 0.02) and lifetime PTSD (p = 0.005) were associated with GrimAge acceleration, indicative of a shorter predicted lifespan. The association with lifetime PTSD was replicated in an independent cohort (p = 0.04). In the MRI sub sample, GrimAge acceleration also associated with cortical atrophy in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.03) and right posterior cingulate (p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.04), brain areas associated with emotion-regulation and threat-regulation. Our findings suggest that lifetime trauma and PTSD may contribute to a higher epigenetic-based mortality risk. We also demonstrate a relationship between cortical atrophy in PTSD-relevant brain regions and shorter predicted lifespan.",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology
Childhood maltreatment and HPA axis gene expression in bipolar disorders: A gene network analysis.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is highly associated with childhood maltreatment (CM), the exposure to such early adversity being suggested to disrupt the expression of several biological pathways.

Dynamic Patterns of Threat-Associated Gene Expression in the Amygdala and Blood.,"Stress and trauma profoundly influence psychiatric biobehavioral outcomes. The identification of treatment and biomarker targets would be accelerated by a broad understanding of the biological responses to these events. The goal of this study was to determine genes responsive to auditory fear conditioning (FC), a well-characterized amygdala-dependent rodent model of threat-exposure, in the presence or absence of prior stress history, providing insight into the physiological processes underlying response to trauma. RNA-sequencing was performed in blood and amygdala from mice that underwent fear conditioning with (Immo+FC) and without (FC) prior immobilization stress, a paradigm that induces HPA axis, and behavioral stress sensitization. In the amygdala, 607 genes were regulated by FC vs. home-cage (HC) controls, and 516 genes differed in stress-sensitized mice (Immo+FC vs. FC). In the former, we observed an enhancement of specific biological processes involved in learning and synaptic transmission, and in the latter processes associated with cell proliferation and the cellular response to drugs. In the blood of stress-sensitized animals, 468 genes were dynamically regulated when compared to FC, and were enriched for the biological pathways of inflammation and cytokine signaling. This study identified genes and pathways that respond to threat in the amygdala and blood of mice with and without a prior stress history and reveals the impact of stress history on subsequent inflammation. Future studies will be needed to examine the role of these dynamically regulated genes may play in human clinical stress and trauma-related disorders.",Frontiers in psychiatry
Gut Microbiota Regulates Epigenetic Remodelling in the Amygdala: A Role in Repeated Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (rMTBI)-Induced Anxiety.,"Gut microbiota serves in the development and maintenance of phenotype. However, the underlying mechanisms are still in its infancy. The current study shows epigenetic remodelling in the brain as a causal mechanism in the gut microbiota-brain axis. Like in trauma patients, gut dysbiosis and anxiety were comorbid in adult male Wistar rats subjected to repeated mild traumatic brain injuries (rMTBI). rMTBI caused epigenetic dysregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) expression in the amygdala, owing to the formation of transcriptional co-repressor complex due to dynamic interaction between histone deacetylase and DNA methylation modification at the Bdnf gene promoter. The probiosis after faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy naïve rats or by administration of single strain probiotic (SSP), Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), recuperated rMTBI-induced anxiety. Concurrently, LGG infusion or naïve FMT also dislodged rMTBI-induced co-repressor complex resulting in the normalization of Bdnf expression and neuronal plasticity as measured by Golgi-Cox staining. Furthermore, sodium butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, produced neurobehavioural effects similar to naïve FMT or LGG administration. Interestingly, the gut microbiota from rMTBI-exposed rats per se was able to provoke anxiety in naïve rats in parallel with BDNF deficits. Therefore, gut microbiota seems to be causally linked with the chromatin remodelling necessary for neuroadaptations via neuronal plasticity which drives experience-dependent behavioural manifestations.",Molecular neurobiology
C-Reactive Protein: Marker of risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and its potential for a mechanistic role in trauma response and recovery.,"Increasing evidence indicates that inflammation plays a role in PTSD and stress disorder pathophysiology. PTSD is consistently associated with higher circulating inflammatory protein levels. Rodent models demonstrate that inflammation promotes enduring avoidance and arousal behaviors after severe stressors (e.g., predator exposure and social defeat), suggesting that inflammation may play a mechanistic role in trauma disorders. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an innate acute phase reactant produced by the liver after acute infection and chronic disease. A growing number of investigations report associations with PTSD diagnosis and elevated peripheral CRP, CRP gene mutations, and CRP gene expression changes in immune signaling pathways. CRP is reasonably established as a potential marker of PTSD and trauma exposure, but if and how it may play a mechanistic role is unclear. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of immune mechanisms in PTSD with a particular focus on the innate immune signaling factor, CRP. We found that although there is consistent evidence of an association of CRP with PTSD symptoms and risk, there is a paucity of data on how CRP might contribute to CNS inflammation in PTSD, and consequently, PTSD symptoms. We discuss potential mechanisms through which CRP could modulate enduring peripheral and CNS stress responses, along with future areas of investigation probing the role of CRP and other innate immune signaling factors in modulating trauma responses. Overall, we found that CRP likely contributes to central inflammation, but how it does so is an area for further study.",The European journal of neuroscience
Gene expression associated with PTSD in World Trade Center responders: An RNA sequencing study.,"The gene expression approach has provided promising insights into the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, few studies used hypothesis-free transcriptome-wide approach to comprehensively understand gene expression underpinning PTSD. A transcriptome-wide expression study using RNA sequencing of whole blood was conducted in 324 World Trade Center responders (201 with never, 81 current, 42 past PTSD). Samples from current and never PTSD reponders were randomly split to form discovery (N = 195) and replication (N = 87) cohorts. Differentially expressed genes were used in pathway analysis and to create a polygenic expression score. There were 448 differentially expressed genes in the discovery cohort, of which 99 remained significant in the replication cohort, including FKBP5, which was found to be up-regulated in current PTSD regardless of the genotypes. Several enriched biological pathways were found, including glucocorticoid receptor signaling and immunity-related pathways, but these pathways did not survive FDR correction. The polygenic expression score computed by aggregating 30 differentially expressed genes using the elastic net algorithm achieved sensitivity/specificity of 0.917/0.508, respectively for identifying current PTSD in the replication cohort. Polygenic scores were similar in current and past PTSD, with both groups scoring higher than trauma-exposed controls without any history of PTSD. Together with the pathway analysis results, these findings point to HPA-axis and immune dysregulation as key biological processes underpinning PTSD. A novel polygenic expression aggregate that differentiates PTSD patients from trauma-exposed controls might be a useful screening tool for research and clinical practice, if replicated in other populations.",Translational psychiatry
Interaction between COMT Val<sup>158</sup> Met polymorphism and childhood trauma predicts risk for depression in men.,"Depression is a disabling illness with complex etiology. While the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, in particular the functional Val<sup>158</sup> Met polymorphism, has been related to depression, the mechanisms underlying this gene-disease association are not completely understood. Therefore, we explore the association of COMT Val<sup>158</sup> Met polymorphism with depression as well as its interaction with childhood trauma in 1136 young adults from a population-based study carried out in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. The diagnosis was performed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0 (MINI 5.0), and trauma was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Total DNA was extracted and genotyped by real-time PCR, and the QTLbase dataset was queried to perform large-scale quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Our research showed no direct association between the Val<sup>158</sup> Met polymorphism and the diagnosis of depression (women: χ<sup>2</sup>  = 0.10, d = 1, p = 0.751; men: χ<sup>2</sup>  = 0.003, df = 1, p = 0.956). However, the Met-allele of the Val<sup>158</sup> Met polymorphism modified the effect of childhood trauma in men (OR = 2.58 [95% CI: 1.05-6.29]; p = 0.038) conferring risk for depression only on those who suffer from trauma. The conditional effect from moderation analysis showed that trauma impacts the risk of depression only in men carrying the Met-allele (effect: 0.9490, standard error [SE]: 0.2570; p = 0.0002). QTLbase and dataset for Val<sup>158</sup> Met polymorphism were consistent for markers that influence chromatin accessibility transcription capacity including histone methylation and acetylation. The changes caused in gene regulation by childhood trauma exposure and polymorphism may serve as evidence of the mechanism whereby the interaction increases susceptibility to this disorder in men.",International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience
The role of genes in defining a molecular biology of PTSD.,"Because environmental exposure to trauma is the sine qua non for the development of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the recent focus on genetic studies has been noteworthy. The main catalyst for such studies is the observation from epidemiological studies that not all trauma survivors develop this disorder. Furthermore, neuroendocrine findings suggest pre-existing hormonal alterations that confer risk for PTSD. This paper presents the rationale for examining genetic factors in PTSD and trauma exposure, but suggests that studies of genotype may only present a limited picture of the molecular biology of this disorder. We describe the type of information that can be obtained from candidate gene and genomic studies that incorporate environmental factors in the design (i.e., gene - environment interaction and gene-environment correlation studies) and studies that capitalize on the idea that environment modifies gene expression, via epigenetic or other molecular mechanisms. The examination of epigenetic mechanisms in tandem with gene expression will help refine models that explain how PTSD risk, pathophysiology, and recovery is mediated by the environment. Since inherited genetic variation may also influence the extent of epigenetic or gene expression changes resulting from the environment, such studies should optimally be followed up by studies of genotype.",Disease markers
Epigenetic and Coping Mechanisms of Stress in Affective Disorders: A Scoping Review.,"This review aims to explore the intricate relationship among epigenetic mechanisms, stress, and affective disorders, focusing on how early life experiences and coping mechanisms contribute to susceptibility to mood disorders. Epigenetic factors play a crucial role in regulating gene expression without altering the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequence, and recent research has revealed associations between epigenetic changes and maladaptive responses to stress or psychiatric disorders. A scoping review of 33 studies employing the PRISMA-S (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Statement) guidelines investigates the role of stress-induced epigenetic mechanisms and coping strategies in affective disorder occurrence, development, and progression. The analysis encompasses various stress factors, including childhood trauma, work-related stress, and dietary deficiencies, alongside epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and altered gene expression. Findings indicate that specific stress-related genes frequently exhibit epigenetic changes associated with affective disorders. Moreover, the review examines coping mechanisms in patients with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, revealing mixed associations between coping strategies and symptom severity. While active coping is correlated with better outcomes, emotion-focused coping may exacerbate depressive or manic episodes. Overall, this review underscores the complex interplay among genetic predisposition, environmental stressors, coping mechanisms, and affective disorders. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing targeted interventions and personalized treatment strategies for individuals with mood disorders. However, further research is needed to elucidate specific genomic loci involved in affective disorders and the clinical implications of coping strategies in therapeutic settings.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)"

Genome-wide DNA methylation levels and altered cortisol stress reactivity following childhood trauma in humans.,"DNA methylation likely plays a role in the regulation of human stress reactivity. Here we show that in a genome-wide analysis of blood DNA methylation in 85 healthy individuals, a locus in the Kit ligand gene (KITLG; cg27512205) showed the strongest association with cortisol stress reactivity (P=5.8 × 10(-6)). Replication was obtained in two independent samples using either blood (N=45, P=0.001) or buccal cells (N=255, P=0.004). KITLG methylation strongly mediates the relationship between childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity in the discovery sample (32% mediation). Its genomic location, a CpG island shore within an H3K27ac enhancer mark, and the correlation between methylation in the blood and prefrontal cortex provide further evidence that KITLG methylation is functionally relevant for the programming of stress reactivity in the human brain.

A previous epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) study investigating human newborns and two animal models of ELS suggested that the epigenetic regulator MORC1 is differentially methylated following ELS. The ELS-induced DNAm alterations were long-lasting in the animal models. However, whether this finding is also transferable to humans experiencing ELS in childhood was not investigated. Further, MORC1 may provide a link between ELS and adult depression, as MORC1 DNAm and genetic variants were found to be associated with depressive symptoms in humans. In the present study, we investigated the validity of MORC1 DNAm as a biomarker of ELS in humans and its role in linking ELS to depression later in life by studying childhood maltreatment. We analyzed whole blood MORC1 DNAm in an adult cohort (N = 151) that was characterized for both the presence of depressive symptoms and childhood maltreatment. Further, we investigated the association between MORC1 DNAm, depressive symptoms and childhood maltreatment in two additional cohorts (N = 299, N = 310). Overall, our data do not indicate an association of MORC1 DNAm with childhood maltreatment. An association of MORC1 DNAm with depressive symptoms was present in all cohorts, but was inconsistent in the specific CpG sites associated and the direction of effect (Tuebingen cohort: standardized β = 0.16, unstandardized β = 0.01, 95% CI [-0.0004, -0.0179], p = 0.061, PReDICT cohort: standardized β = -0.12, unstandardized β = -0.01, 95% CI [-0.0258, -0.0003], p = 0.045), Grady cohort: standardized β = 0.16, unstandardized β = 0.008, 95% CI [0.0019, 0.0143], p = 0.01). Our study thus suggests that peripheral MORC1 DNAm cannot serve as biomarker of childhood maltreatment in adults, but does provide further indication for the association of MORC1 DNAm with depressive symptoms.",Journal of psychiatric research
Associations of altered leukocyte DDR1 promoter methylation and childhood trauma with bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior in euthymic patients.,"Altered DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) have been found in the blood and brain of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and the brain of patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Childhood trauma (CT) is associated with changes in DNAm that in turn are related to suicidal behavior (SB) in patients with several psychiatric disorders. Here, using MassARRAY® technology, we studied 128 patients diagnosed with BD in remission and 141 healthy controls (HCs) to compare leukocyte DDR1 promoter DNAm patterns between patients and HCs and between patients with and without SB. Additionally, we investigated whether CT was associated with DDR1 DNAm and mediated SB. We found hypermethylation at DDR1 cg19215110 and cg23953820 sites and hypomethylation at cg14279856 and cg03270204 sites in patients with BD compared to HCs. Logistic regression models showed that hypermethylation of DDR1 cg23953820 but not cg19215110 and CT were risk factors for BD, while cg14279856 and cg03270204 hypomethylation were protective factors. In patients, CT was a risk factor for SB, but DDR1 DNAm, although associated with CT, did not mediate the association of CT with SB. This is the first study demonstrating altered leukocyte DDR1 promoter DNAm in euthymic patients with BD. We conclude that altered DDR1 DNAm may be related to immune and inflammatory mechanisms and could be a potential blood biomarker for the diagnosis and stratification of psychiatric patients.",Molecular psychiatry
miR-34b attenuates trauma-induced anxiety-like behavior by targeting CRHR1.,"Exposure to trauma is a potential contributor to anxiety; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for trauma-induced anxiety require further clarification. In this study, in an aim to explore these mechanisms, we observed the changes in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis using a radioimmunoassay and the changes in anxiety-like behavior using the open field test and elevated plus maze test in a rat model following intervention with NBI‑27914, a specific corticotropin‑releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) antagonist. CRHR1 was found to be involved in trauma‑induced anxiety. We then applied bioinformatic analysis to screen microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) that target CRHR1, and miR‑34b was determined to negatively regulate CRHR1 mRNA in primary hypothalamic neurons. The overexpression of miR‑34b in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) by a miRNA agomir using a drug delivery system decreased the hyperactivity of the HPA axis and anxiety‑like behavior. Overall, the involvement of the HPA axis in trauma‑induced anxiety was demonstrated, and trauma-induced anxiety was attenuated by decreasing the hyperactivity of the HPA axis via miR‑34b by targeting CRHR1.",International journal of molecular medicine
"Epigenetics of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Current Evidence, Challenges, and Future Directions.","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a stress-related psychiatric disorder that is thought to emerge from complex interactions among traumatic events and multiple genetic factors. Epigenetic regulation lies at the heart of these interactions and mediates the lasting effects of the environment on gene regulation. An increasing body of evidence in human subjects with PTSD supports a role for epigenetic regulation of distinct genes and pathways in the pathogenesis of PTSD. The role of epigenetic regulation is further supported by studies examining fear conditioning in rodent models. Although this line of research offers an exciting outlook for future epigenetic research in PTSD, important limitations include the tissue specificity of epigenetic modifications, the phenomenologic definition of the disorder, and the challenge of translating molecular evidence across species. These limitations call for studies that combine data from postmortem human brain tissue and animal models, assess longitudinal epigenetic changes in living subjects, and examine dimensional phenotypes in addition to diagnoses. Moreover, examining the environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors that promote resilience to trauma may lead to important advances in the field.",Biological psychiatry
Intergenerational trauma transmission is associated with brain metabotranscriptome remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction.,"Intergenerational trauma increases lifetime susceptibility to depression and other psychiatric disorders. Whether intergenerational trauma transmission is a consequence of in-utero neurodevelopmental disruptions versus early-life mother-infant interaction is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that trauma exposure during pregnancy induces in mouse offspring social deficits and depressive-like behavior. Normal pups raised by traumatized mothers exhibited similar behavioral deficits to those induced in pups raised by their biological traumatized mothers. Good caregiving by normal mothers did not reverse prenatal trauma-induced behaviors, indicating a two-hit stress mechanism comprising both in-utero abnormalities and early-life poor parenting. The behavioral deficits were associated with profound changes in the brain metabotranscriptome. Striking increases in the mitochondrial hypoxia marker and epigenetic modifier 2-hydroxyglutaric acid in the brains of neonates and adults exposed prenatally to trauma indicated mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic mechanisms. Bioinformatic analyses revealed stress- and hypoxia-response metabolic pathways in the neonates, which produced long-lasting alterations in mitochondrial energy metabolism and epigenetic processes (DNA and chromatin modifications). Most strikingly, early pharmacological interventions with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) supplementation produced long-lasting protection against intergenerational trauma-induced depression.",Communications biology
Genomewide DNA methylation analysis in combat veterans reveals a novel locus for PTSD.,Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may play a key role in the aetiology and serve as biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

"DNA methylation of NR3C1 and FKBP5 is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, posttraumatic growth, and resilience.","Understandings of the biological mechanisms underpinning posttrauma responses are limited. This pilot study aimed to expand research in this area by examining the relationship between DNA methylation of stress genes nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (<i>NR3C1</i>) and FK06 binding protein 5 (<i>FKBP5</i>) with an array of posttrauma responses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, posttraumatic growth (PTG), and resilience.","Psychological trauma : theory, research, practice and policy"
Association between DNA methylation of the KITLG gene and cortisol levels under stress: a replication study.,"A recent study reported for the first time, that DNA methylation of the KITLG gene mediates the association between childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity. Our study aimed to provide the first independent replication of these findings. ESPRIT is a prospective study of community-dwelling participants (age ≥ 65), randomly selected from the electoral rolls of the Montpellier district, in France. Clinical depression was assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, French version 5.00), and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Experiences of childhood adversity were ascertained via a 25-item questionnaire. Morning, evening, and diurnal salivary cortisol was measured under basal and stress conditions and determined using direct radioimmunoassay analysis. DNA methylation of the KITLG gene was quantified in whole blood using the SEQUENOM MassARRAY EpiTYPER platform. A significant negative association was observed between KITLG DNA methylation and both morning cortisol (β = -1.846 ± 0.666, p = .007) and diurnal cortisol (area under curve [AUC]) (β = -19.429 ± 8.868, p = .031) under a stress condition. However, only the former association was significant after correcting for multiple testing. Further, this association remained after adjusting for age, sex, and depression status. No significant association was observed between childhood trauma and KITLG DNA methylation in this older population. This study provides support for an association between KITLG methylation and stress cortisol levels, suggesting that DNA methylation of this gene may play a role in the longer term regulation of the stress system. Lay summary   The significant negative association between KITLG DNA methylation and morning cortisol, measured under a stressful condition, suggests that individuals with higher KITLG methylation will secrete lower levels of cortisol whilst under stress.","Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"
Trauma-induced suppression of antigen presentation and expression of major histocompatibility class II antigen complex in leukocytes.,"The immune response to trauma, shock, and/or sepsis appears to exhibit a bimodal response, in which there is an early exaggerated inflammatory response, giving way over time to a state of hyporesponsiveness or immune dysfunction. This state of immune dysfunction is frequently associated with increased infectious complications and/or mortality, seen following shock or trauma. In this article, we present an overview of some of those changes that have been seen with respect to the process of major histocompatibility class II (MHC class II) antigen presentation by macrophage, a key component of the overall host immune response to foreign bacterial and/or fungal pathogens encountered following shock/trauma (with a particular emphasis on hemorrhagic shock as a component of traumatic shock). With respect to the overall process of antigen presentation, defects (dysfunction) are evident not only in models of shock and sepsis, but also in traumatized patients. Studies of the capacity of a monocyte's/macrophage's ability to present antigen indicate that defects can be detected, not only in those steps involved in antigenic processing, but also in MHC class II molecule expression and accessory molecule function (or its inhibition) following shock. Those changes in the macrophage's capacity to process antigen seen during the first 24 h after hemorrhagic shock appear to be associated with the cell's metabolic response to regional hypoxia and/or the shift to proinflammatory mediator release (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, etc.). This initial acute response to shock appears to act as the nidus for chronic anti-inflammatory mediator release (prostaglandin E2, transforming growth factor-beta, IL-10, IL-4, nitric oxide, etc.), which may mediate the sustained depression of the antigen-presenting cell's function.","Shock (Augusta, Ga.)"
"Cumulative stress, PTSD, and emotion dysregulation during pregnancy and epigenetic age acceleration in Hispanic mothers and their newborn infants.","Pregnancy can exacerbate or prompt the onset of stress-related disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is associated with heightened stress responsivity and emotional dysregulation, as well as increased risk of chronic disorders and mortality. Further, maternal PTSD is associated with gestational epigenetic age acceleration in newborns, implicating the prenatal period as a developmental time period for the transmission of effects across generations. Here, we evaluated the associations between PTSD symptoms, maternal epigenetic age acceleration, and infant gestational epigenetic age acceleration in 89 maternal-neonatal dyads. Trauma-related experiences and PTSD symptoms in mothers were assessed during the third trimester of pregnancy. The MethylationEPIC array was used to generate DNA methylation data from maternal and neonatal saliva samples collected within 24 h of infant birth. Maternal epigenetic age acceleration was calculated using Horvath's multi-tissue clock, PhenoAge and GrimAge. Gestational epigenetic age was estimated using the Haftorn clock. Maternal cumulative past-year stress (GrimAge: <i>p</i> = 3.23e-04, PhenoAge: <i>p</i> = 9.92e-03), PTSD symptoms (GrimAge: <i>p</i> = 0.019), and difficulties in emotion regulation (GrimAge: <i>p</i> = 0.028) were associated with accelerated epigenetic age in mothers. Maternal PTSD symptoms were associated with lower gestational epigenetic age acceleration in neonates (<i>p</i> = 0.032). Overall, our results suggest that maternal cumulative past-year stress exposure and trauma-related symptoms may increase the risk for age-related problems in mothers and developmental problems in their newborns.",Epigenetics
