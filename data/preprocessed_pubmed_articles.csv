"Mapping 123 million neonatal, infant and child deaths between 2000 and 2017.","Since 2000, many countries have achieved considerable success in improving child survival, but localized progress remains unclear. To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2-to end preventable child deaths by 2030-we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000-2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations.",Nature,"[""since"", ""many"", ""country"", ""achieve"", ""considerable"", ""success"", ""improve"", ""child"", ""survival"", ""localized"", ""progress"", ""remain"", ""unclear"", ""inform"", ""effort"", ""towards"", ""united"", ""nation"", ""sustainable"", ""development"", ""goal"", ""end"", ""preventable"", ""child"", ""death"", ""need"", ""consistently"", ""estimate"", ""datum"", ""subnational"", ""level"", ""regard"", ""child"", ""mortality"", ""rate"", ""trend"", ""quantify"", ""period"", ""subnational"", ""variation"", ""mortality"", ""rate"", ""number"", ""death"", ""neonate"", ""infant"", ""child"", ""year"", ""age"", ""within"", ""low"", ""middle"", ""income"", ""country"", ""use"", ""geostatistical"", ""survival"", ""model"", ""estimate"", ""child"", ""country"", ""live"", ""district"", ""attain"", ""rate"", ""few"", ""child"", ""death"", ""per"", ""live"", ""birth"", ""child"", ""death"", ""country"", ""could"", ""avert"", ""absence"", ""geographical"", ""inequality"", ""enable"", ""identification"", ""high"", ""mortality"", ""cluster"", ""pattern"", ""progress"", ""geographical"", ""inequality"", ""inform"", ""appropriate"", ""investment"", ""implementation"", ""help"", ""improve"", ""health"", ""population""]",None,None,None,None
Epigenetic clocks may come out of rhythm-implications for the estimation of chronological age in forensic casework.,"There is a growing perception that DNA methylation may be influenced by exogenous and endogenous parameters. Knowledge of these factors is of great relevance for the interpretation of DNA-methylation data for the estimation of chronological age in forensic casework. We performed a literature review to identify parameters, which might be of relevance for the prediction of chronological age based on DNA methylation. The quality of age predictions might particularly be influenced by lifetime adversities (chronic stress, trauma/post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), violence, low socioeconomic status/education), cancer, obesity and related diseases, infectious diseases (especially HIV and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections), sex, ethnicity and exposure to toxins (alcohol, smoking, air pollution, pesticides). Such factors may alter the DNA methylation pattern and may explain the partly high deviations between epigenetic age and chronological age in single cases (despite of low mean absolute deviations) that can also be observed with ""epigenetic clocks"" comprising a high number of CpG sites. So far, only few publications dealing with forensic age estimation address these confounding factors. Future research should focus on the identification of further relevant confounding factors and the development of models that are ""robust"" against the influence of such biological factors by systematic investigations under targeted inclusion of diverse and defined cohorts.",International journal of legal medicine,"[""grow"", ""perception"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""may"", ""influence"", ""exogenous"", ""endogenous"", ""parameter"", ""knowledge"", ""factor"", ""great"", ""relevance"", ""interpretation"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""datum"", ""estimation"", ""chronological"", ""age"", ""forensic"", ""casework"", ""perform"", ""literature"", ""review"", ""identify"", ""parameter"", ""might"", ""relevance"", ""prediction"", ""chronological"", ""age"", ""based"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""quality"", ""age"", ""prediction"", ""might"", ""particularly"", ""influence"", ""lifetime"", ""adversity"", ""chronic"", ""stress"", ""trauma"", ""post"", ""traumatic"", ""stress"", ""disorder"", ""ptsd"", ""violence"", ""low"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""education"", ""cancer"", ""obesity"", ""related"", ""disease"", ""infectious"", ""disease"", ""especially"", ""hiv"", ""cytomegalovirus"", ""cmv"", ""infection"", ""sex"", ""ethnicity"", ""exposure"", ""toxin"", ""alcohol"", ""smoking"", ""air"", ""pollution"", ""pesticide"", ""factor"", ""may"", ""alter"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""pattern"", ""may"", ""explain"", ""partly"", ""high"", ""deviation"", ""epigenetic"", ""age"", ""chronological"", ""age"", ""single"", ""case"", ""despite"", ""low"", ""mean"", ""absolute"", ""deviation"", ""also"", ""observe"", ""epigenetic"", ""clock"", ""comprise"", ""high"", ""number"", ""cpg"", ""site"", ""far"", ""publication"", ""deal"", ""forensic"", ""age"", ""estimation"", ""address"", ""confounding"", ""factor"", ""future"", ""research"", ""focus"", ""identification"", ""relevant"", ""confounding"", ""factor"", ""development"", ""model"", ""robust"", ""influence"", ""biological"", ""factor"", ""systematic"", ""investigation"", ""target"", ""inclusion"", ""diverse"", ""define"", ""cohort""]",PTSD,DNA methylation,socioeconomic status,ethnicity
Leukocyte methylomic imprints of exposure to the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda: a pilot epigenome-wide analysis.,"<b>Aim & methods:</b> We conducted a pilot epigenome-wide association study of women from Tutsi ethnicity exposed to the genocide while pregnant and their resulting offspring, and a comparison group of women who were pregnant at the time of the genocide but living outside of Rwanda.<b>Results:</b> Fifty-nine leukocyte-derived DNA samples survived quality control: 33 mothers (20 exposed, 13 unexposed) and 26 offspring (16 exposed, 10 unexposed). Twenty-four significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in mothers and 16 in children. <b>Conclusions:</b><i>In utero</i> genocide exposure was associated with CpGs in three of the 24 DMRs: <i>BCOR</i>, <i>PRDM8</i> and <i>VWDE</i>, with higher DNA methylation in exposed versus unexposed offspring. Of note, <i>BCOR</i> and <i>VWDE</i> show significant correlation between brain and blood DNA methylation within individuals, suggesting these peripherally derived signals of genocide exposure may have relevance to the brain.",Epigenomics,"[""aim"", ""method"", ""conduct"", ""pilot"", ""epigenome"", ""wide"", ""association"", ""woman"", ""tutsi"", ""ethnicity"", ""expose"", ""genocide"", ""pregnant"", ""result"", ""offspring"", ""comparison"", ""group"", ""woman"", ""pregnant"", ""time"", ""genocide"", ""live"", ""outside"", ""rwanda"", ""fifty"", ""nine"", ""leukocyte"", ""derived"", ""dna"", ""sample"", ""survive"", ""quality"", ""mother"", ""expose"", ""unexpose"", ""offspring"", ""expose"", ""unexpose"", ""twenty"", ""four"", ""differentially"", ""methylate"", ""region"", ""dmrs"", ""identify"", ""mother"", ""child"", ""conclusion"", ""utero"", ""genocide"", ""exposure"", ""associated"", ""cpgs"", ""three"", ""dmrs"", ""bcor"", ""vwde"", ""high"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""expose"", ""versus"", ""unexposed"", ""offspring"", ""note"", ""bcor"", ""vwde"", ""show"", ""correlation"", ""brain"", ""blood"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""within"", ""individual"", ""suggest"", ""peripherally"", ""derive"", ""signal"", ""genocide"", ""exposure"", ""may"", ""relevance"", ""brain""]",None,DNA methylation,None,ethnicity
Methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene mediates the effect of adversity on negative schemas and depression.,"Building upon various lines of research, we posited that methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) would mediate the effect of adult adversity on increased commitment to negative schemas and in turn the development of depression. We tested our model using structural equation modeling and longitudinal data from a sample of 100 middle-aged, African American women. The results provided strong support for the model. Analysis of the 12 CpG sites available for the promoter region of the OXTR gene identified four factors. One of these factors was related to the study variables, whereas the others were not. This factor mediated the effect of adult adversity on schemas relating to pessimism and distrust, and these schemas, in turn, mediated the impact of OXTR methylation on depression. All indirect effects were statistically significant, and they remained significant after controlling for childhood trauma, age, romantic relationship status, individual differences in cell types, and average level of genome-wide methylation. These finding suggest that epigenetic regulation of the oxytocin system may be a mechanism whereby the negative cognitions central to depression become biologically embedded.",Development and psychopathology,"[""building"", ""upon"", ""various"", ""line"", ""research"", ""posit"", ""methylation"", ""oxytocin"", ""receptor"", ""gene"", ""oxtr"", ""would"", ""mediate"", ""effect"", ""adult"", ""adversity"", ""increase"", ""commitment"", ""negative"", ""schema"", ""turn"", ""development"", ""depression"", ""test"", ""model"", ""use"", ""structural"", ""equation"", ""model"", ""longitudinal"", ""datum"", ""sample"", ""middle"", ""aged"", ""african"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""provide"", ""strong"", ""support"", ""model"", ""analysis"", ""cpg"", ""site"", ""available"", ""promoter"", ""region"", ""oxtr"", ""gene"", ""identify"", ""four"", ""factor"", ""one"", ""factor"", ""related"", ""variable"", ""whereas"", ""other"", ""factor"", ""mediated"", ""effect"", ""adult"", ""adversity"", ""schema"", ""relate"", ""pessimism"", ""distrust"", ""schema"", ""turn"", ""mediate"", ""impact"", ""oxtr"", ""methylation"", ""depression"", ""indirect"", ""effect"", ""statistically"", ""remain"", ""control"", ""childhood"", ""trauma"", ""age"", ""romantic"", ""relationship"", ""status"", ""individual"", ""difference"", ""cell"", ""type"", ""average"", ""level"", ""genome"", ""wide"", ""methylation"", ""finding"", ""suggest"", ""epigenetic"", ""regulation"", ""oxytocin"", ""system"", ""may"", ""mechanism"", ""whereby"", ""negative"", ""cognition"", ""central"", ""depression"", ""become"", ""biologically"", ""embedded""]",depression,None,None,African American
Problematic alcohol use associates with sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) in trauma-exposed populations.,"Excessive alcohol use is extremely prevalent in the United States, particularly among trauma-exposed individuals. While several studies have examined genetic influences on alcohol use and related problems, this has not been studied in the context of trauma-exposed populations. We report results from a genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and associated problems as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in a trauma-exposed cohort. Results indicate a genome-wide significant association between total AUDIT score and rs1433375 [N = 1036, P = 2.61 × 10<sup>-8</sup> (dominant model), P = 7.76 × 10<sup>-8</sup> (additive model)], an intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism located 323 kb upstream of the sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) at 4q28. rs1433375 was also significant in a meta-analysis of two similar, but independent, cohorts (N = 1394, P = 0.0004), the Marine Resiliency Study and Systems Biology PTSD Biomarkers Consortium. Functional analysis indicated that rs1433375 was associated with SCLT1 gene expression and cortical-cerebellar functional connectivity measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Together, findings suggest a role for sodium channel regulation and cerebellar functioning in alcohol use behavior.

Influence of child abuse on adult depression: moderation by the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene.,"Genetic inheritance and developmental life stress both contribute to major depressive disorder in adults.

Molecular variation at the SLC6A3 locus predicts lifetime risk of PTSD in the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study.,"Recent work suggests that the 9-repeat (9R) allele located in the 3'UTR VNTR of the SLC6A3 gene increases risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no study reporting this association to date has been based on population-based samples. Furthermore, no study of which we are aware has assessed the joint action of genetic and DNA methylation variation at SLC6A3 on risk of PTSD. In this study, we assessed whether molecular variation at SLC6A3 locus influences risk of PTSD. Participants (n = 320; 62 cases/258 controls) were drawn from an urban, community-based sample of predominantly African American Detroit adult residents, and included those who had completed a baseline telephone survey, had provided blood specimens, and had a homozygous genotype for either the 9R or 10R allele or a heterozygous 9R/10R genotype. The influence of DNA methylation variation in the SLC6A3 promoter locus was also assessed in a subset of participants with available methylation data (n = 83; 16 cases/67 controls). In the full analytic sample, 9R allele carriers had almost double the risk of lifetime PTSD compared to 10R/10R genotype carriers (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.02-3.86), controlling for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, number of traumas, smoking, and lifetime depression. In the subsample of participants with available methylation data, a significant (p = 0.008) interaction was observed whereby 9R allele carriers showed an increased risk of lifetime PTSD only in conjunction with high methylation in the SLC6A3 promoter locus, controlling for the same covariates. Our results confirm previous reports supporting a role for the 9R allele in increasing susceptibility to PTSD. They further extend these findings by providing preliminary evidence that a ""double hit"" model, including both a putatively reduced-function allele and high methylation in the promoter region, may more accurately capture molecular risk of PTSD at the SLC6A3 locus.",PloS one,"[""recent"", ""work"", ""suggest"", ""repeat"", ""allele"", ""located"", ""utr"", ""vntr"", ""gene"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""posttraumatic"", ""stress"", ""disorder"", ""ptsd"", ""however"", ""report"", ""association"", ""date"", ""base"", ""population"", ""base"", ""sample"", ""furthermore"", ""aware"", ""assess"", ""joint"", ""action"", ""genetic"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""variation"", ""risk"", ""ptsd"", ""assess"", ""whether"", ""molecular"", ""variation"", ""locus"", ""influence"", ""risk"", ""ptsd"", ""participant"", ""case"", ""control"", ""draw"", ""urban"", ""community"", ""based"", ""sample"", ""predominantly"", ""african"", ""american"", ""detroit"", ""adult"", ""resident"", ""include"", ""complete"", ""baseline"", ""telephone"", ""survey"", ""provide"", ""blood"", ""specimen"", ""homozygous"", ""genotype"", ""either"", ""allele"", ""heterozygous"", ""genotype"", ""influence"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""variation"", ""promoter"", ""locus"", ""also"", ""assess"", ""subset"", ""participant"", ""available"", ""methylation"", ""data"", ""case"", ""control"", ""full"", ""analytic"", ""sample"", ""allele"", ""carrier"", ""almost"", ""double"", ""risk"", ""lifetime"", ""ptsd"", ""compare"", ""genotype"", ""carrier"", ""control"", ""age"", ""sex"", ""race"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""number"", ""trauma"", ""smoke"", ""lifetime"", ""depression"", ""subsample"", ""participant"", ""available"", ""methylation"", ""data"", ""interaction"", ""observe"", ""whereby"", ""allele"", ""carrier"", ""show"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""lifetime"", ""ptsd"", ""conjunction"", ""high"", ""methylation"", ""promoter"", ""locus"", ""controlling"", ""covariate"", ""confirm"", ""previous"", ""report"", ""support"", ""role"", ""allele"", ""increase"", ""susceptibility"", ""ptsd"", ""extend"", ""finding"", ""provide"", ""preliminary"", ""evidence"", ""double"", ""hit"", ""model"", ""include"", ""putatively"", ""reduce"", ""function"", ""allele"", ""high"", ""methylation"", ""promoter"", ""region"", ""may"", ""accurately"", ""capture"", ""molecular"", ""risk"", ""ptsd"", ""locus""]","depression, PTSD",DNA methylation,socioeconomic status,"race, African American"
