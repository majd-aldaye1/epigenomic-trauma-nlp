Childhood Trauma and Epigenetics: State of the Science and Future.,"There is a great deal of interest regarding the biological embedding of childhood trauma and social exposures through epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), but a comprehensive understanding has been hindered by issues of limited reproducibility between studies. This review presents a summary of the literature on childhood trauma and DNAm, highlights issues in the field, and proposes some potential solutions.",Current environmental health reports
Epigenetics of childhood trauma: Long term sequelae and potential for treatment.,"Childhood trauma (CT) can have persistent effects on the brain and is one of the major risk factors for neuropsychiatric diseases in adulthood. Recent advances in the field of epigenetics suggest that epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as regulatory processes involving non-coding RNA are associated with the long-term sequelae of CT. This narrative review summarizes current knowledge on the epigenetic basis of CT and describes studies in animal models and human subjects examining how the epigenome and transcriptome are modified by CT in the brain. It discusses psychological and pharmacological interventions that can counteract epigenetic changes induced by CT and the need to establish longitudinal assessment after CT for developing more effective diagnostics and treatment strategies based on epigenetic targets.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews
The influence of intergenerational trauma on epigenetics and obesity in Indigenous populations - a scoping review.,"<b>Background:</b> Research has recently begun to examine the potential intergenerational impacts of trauma on obesity.<b>Objective:</b> This scoping review examines the literature on the interactions between intergenerational trauma, epigenetics, and obesity in Indigenous populations. The review was conducted to identify what is known from the literature about how intergenerational trauma may epigenetically influence obesity in Indigenous populations.<b>Methods:</b> Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews, online databases were used to identify studies that included discussion of the four focus topics: trauma, epigenetics, obesity, and Indigeneity. The review resulted in six studies that examined those themes. The focus and findings of the selected studies varied from cultural to biological mechanisms and from discussion regarding trauma, epigenetics, obesity, or Indigeneity, but they support three broad statements. First, they support that obesity has genetic and epigenetic factors. Second, intergenerational trauma is prevalent in Indigenous communities. Finally, intergenerational trauma has cultural and biological influences on obesity.<b>Conclusions:</b> Current literature illustrates that intergenerational trauma has behavioural and epigenetic influences that can lead to increased obesity. This scoping review provides a preliminary map of the current literature and understandings of these topics. This review calls for continued studies regarding the connection between trauma, obesity, and epigenetics in Indigenous communities. Future research is vital for practice and policy surrounding individual and communal healing.",Epigenetics
Epigenetic transmission of Holocaust trauma: can nightmares be inherited?,"The Holocaust left its visible and invisible marks not only on the survivors, but also on their children. Instead of numbers tattooed on their forearms, however, they may have been marked epigenetically with a chemical coating upon their chromosomes, which would represent a kind of biological memory of what the parents experienced. as a result, some suffer from a general vulnerability to stress while others are more resilient. Previous research assumed that such transmission was caused by environmental factors, such as the parents' childrearing behavior. New research, however, indicates that these transgenerational effects may have been also (epi) genetically transmitted to their children. Integrating both hereditary and environmental factors, epigenetics adds a new and more comprehensive psychobiological dimension to the explanation of transgenerational transmission of trauma. Specifically, epigenetics may explain why latent transmission becomes manifest under stress. a general theoretical overview of epigenetics and its relevance to research on trauma transmission is presented.",The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences
Refusing epigenetics: indigeneity and the colonial politics of trauma.,"Environmental epigenetics is increasingly employed to understand the health outcomes of communities who have experienced historical trauma and structural violence. Epigenetics provides a way to think about traumatic events and sustained deprivation as biological ""exposures"" that contribute to ill-health across generations. In Australia, some Indigenous researchers and clinicians are embracing epigenetic science as a framework for theorising the slow violence of colonialism as it plays out in intergenerational legacies of trauma and illness. However, there is dispute, contention, and caution as well as enthusiasm among these research communities.In this article, we trace strategies of ""refusal"" (Simpson, 2014) in response to epigenetics in Indigenous contexts. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Australia with researchers and clinicians in Indigenous health, we explore how some construct epigenetics as useless knowledge and a distraction from implementing anti-colonial change, rather than a tool with which to enact change. Secondly, we explore how epigenetics narrows definitions of colonial harm through the optic of molecular trauma, reproducing conditions in which Indigenous people are made intelligible through a lens of ""damaged"" bodies. Faced with these two concerns, many turn away from epigenetics altogether, refusing its novelty and supposed benefit for Indigenous health equity and resisting the pull of postgenomics.",History and philosophy of the life sciences
"Stress, cortisol and suicide risk.","Suicide is a global health issue accounting for at least 800,000 deaths per annum. Numerous models have been proposed that differ in their emphasis on the role of psychological, social, psychiatric and neurobiological factors in explaining suicide risk. Central to many models is a stress-diathesis component which states that suicidal behavior is the result of an interaction between acutely stressful events and a susceptibility to suicidal behavior (a diathesis). This article presents an overview of studies that demonstrate that stress and dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, as measured by cortisol levels, are important additional risk factors for suicide. Evidence for other putative stress-related suicide risk factors including childhood trauma, impaired executive function, impulsivity and disrupted sleep are considered together with the impact of family history of suicide, perinatal and epigenetic influences on suicide risk.",International review of neurobiology
Peripheral nerve injury and myelination: Potential therapeutic strategies.,"Traumatic peripheral nerve injury represents a major clinical and public health problem that often leads to significant functional impairment and permanent disability. Despite modern diagnostic procedures and advanced microsurgical techniques, functional recovery after peripheral nerve repair is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new therapeutic or adjunctive strategies to promote the functional recovery in nerve injury patients. In contrast to the central nervous system, Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system play a pivotal role in several aspects of nerve repair such as degeneration, remyelination, and axonal growth. Several non-surgical approaches, including pharmacological, electrical, cell-based, and laser therapies, have been employed to promote myelination and enhance functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury. This review will succinctly discuss the potential therapeutic strategies in the context of myelination following peripheral neurotrauma.",Journal of neuroscience research
A review of the genetics and epigenetics of central precocious puberty.,"Gonadotrophin dependent sexual precocity, commonly referred to as central precocious puberty (CPP), results from a premature reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis before the normal age of pubertal onset. CPP is historically described as girls who enter puberty before the age of eight, and boys before the age of nine. Females are more likely to be diagnosed with idiopathic CPP; males diagnosed with CPP have a greater likelihood of a defined etiology. These etiologies may include underlying CNS congenital defects, tumors, trauma, or infections as well as environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recently, genetic variants and mutations which may cause CPP have been identified at both the level of the hypothalamus and the pituitary. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), monogenetic mutations, and modifications of the epigenome have been evaluated in relationship to the onset of puberty; these variants are thought to affect the development, structure and function of GnRH neurons which may lead to either precocious, delayed, or absent pubertal reactivation. This review will describe recent advances in the field of the genetic basis of puberty and provide a clinically relevant approach to better understand these varying etiologies of CPP.",Frontiers in endocrinology
Intrinsic mechanisms of neuronal axon regeneration.,"Permanent disabilities following CNS injuries result from the failure of injured axons to regenerate and rebuild functional connections with their original targets. By contrast, injury to peripheral nerves is followed by robust regeneration, which can lead to recovery of sensory and motor functions. This regenerative response requires the induction of widespread transcriptional and epigenetic changes in injured neurons. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in understanding how peripheral axon injury elicits these widespread changes through the coordinated actions of transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers and, to a lesser extent, microRNAs. Although many questions remain about the interplay between these mechanisms, these new findings provide important insights into the pivotal role of coordinated gene expression and chromatin remodelling in the neuronal response to injury.",Nature reviews.

The epigenetics of early life adversity and trauma inheritance: an interview with Moshe Szyf.,"In this interview, Professor Moshe Szyf speaks with Storm Johnson, Commissioning Editor for <i>Epigenomics</i>, on his work to date in the field of social epigenetics. Szyf received his PhD from the Hebrew University and did his postdoctoral fellowship in genetics at Harvard Medical School, joined the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at McGill University in Montreal in 1989 and is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Academy of Health Sciences of Canada. He is the founding codirector of the Sackler Institute for Epigenetics and Psychobiology at McGill and is a Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Experience-Based Brain and Biological Development program. Szyf was the founder of the first pharma to develop epigenetic pharmacology, Methylgene Inc., and the journal <i>Epigenetics</i>. The Szyf lab proposed two decades ago that DNA methylation is a prime therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases and postulated and provided the first set of evidence that the social environment early in life can alter DNA methylation, launching the emerging field of social epigenetics.",Epigenomics
Epigenetics and gene expression profile in first-episode psychosis: The role of childhood trauma.,"Childhood Trauma (CT) mediation of the epigenome and its impact on gene expression profile could provide a mechanism for the gene-environment interaction underling psychosis. We reviewed the evidence concerning epigenetic and gene expression modifications associated with CT in both First-Episode Psychosis (FEP) and healthy subjects. In order to explore the relative role of psychosis itself in determining these modifications, evidence about FEP and epigenetics/gene expression was also summarized. We performed a systematic search on PubMed, last updated in December 2016. Out of 2966 potentially relevant records, only 41 studies were included. CT resulted associated: in FEP subjects, with global DNA hypo-methylation and reduced BDNF gene-expression; in healthy subjects, with hyper-methylation of SLC6A4, NR3C1, KITLG, and OXTR; hypo-methylation of FKBP5, IL-6, and BDNF; increased IL1B, IL8, and PTGS gene expression; and decreased SLC6A4 gene expression. FEP showed global DNA hypo-methylation; increased methylation and reduced gene expression of GCH1; hyper-expression of MPB, NDEL1, AKT1, and DICER1; and hypo-expression of DROSHA, COMT, and DISC1 in comparison with healthy controls.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews
Establishment of intestinal organoid cultures modeling injury-associated epithelial regeneration.,"The capacity of 3D organoids to mimic physiological tissue organization and functionality has provided an invaluable tool to model development and disease in vitro. However, conventional organoid cultures primarily represent the homeostasis of self-organizing stem cells and their derivatives. Here, we established a novel intestinal organoid culture system composed of 8 components, mainly including VPA, EPZ6438, LDN193189, and R-Spondin 1 conditioned medium, which mimics the gut epithelium regeneration that produces hyperplastic crypts following injury; therefore, these organoids were designated hyperplastic intestinal organoids (Hyper-organoids). Single-cell RNA sequencing identified different regenerative stem cell populations in our Hyper-organoids that shared molecular features with in vivo injury-responsive Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells or Clu<sup>+</sup> revival stem cells. Further analysis revealed that VPA and EPZ6438 were indispensable for epigenome reprogramming and regeneration in Hyper-organoids, which functioned through epigenetically regulating YAP signaling. Furthermore, VPA and EPZ6438 synergistically promoted regenerative response in gut upon damage in vivo. In summary, our results demonstrated a new in vitro organoid model to study epithelial regeneration, highlighting the importance of epigenetic reprogramming that pioneers tissue repair.",Cell research
Inhibition of ferroptosis promotes retina ganglion cell survival in experimental optic neuropathies.,"Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death is a hallmark of traumatic optic neuropathy, glaucoma, and other optic neuropathies that result in irreversible vision loss. However, therapeutic strategies for rescuing RGC loss still remain challenging, and the molecular mechanism underlying RGC loss has not been fully elucidated. Here, we highlight the role of ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death characterized by iron-dependent lethal lipid peroxides accumulation, in RGC death using an experimental model of glaucoma and optic nerve crush (ONC). ONC treatment resulted in significant downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and system xc(-) cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) in the rat retina, accompanied by increased lipid peroxide and iron levels. The reduction of GPx4 expression in RGCs after ONC was confirmed by laser-capture microdissection and PCR. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed alterations in mitochondrial morphology, including increased membrane density and reduced mitochondrial cristae in RGCs after ONC. Notably, the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) significantly promoted RGC survival and preserved retinal function in ONC and microbead-induced glaucoma mouse models. In addition, compared to the apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, Fer-1 showed better effect in rescuing RGCs death in ONC retinas. Mechanistically, we found the downregulation of GPx4 mainly occurred in the mitochondrial compartment, accompanied by increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides. The mitochondria-selective antioxidant MitoTEMPO attenuated RGC loss after ONC, implicating mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxides as major mechanisms in ferroptosis-induced RGC death in ONC retinas. Notably, administering Fer-1 effectively prevented the production of mitochondrial lipid peroxides, the impairment of mitochondrial adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production, and the downregulation of mitochondrial genes, such as mt-Cytb and MT-ATP6, in ONC retinas. Our findings suggest that ferroptosis is a major form of regulated cell death for RGCs in experimental glaucoma and ONC models and suggesting targeting mitochondria-dependent ferroptosis as a protective strategy for RGC injuries in optic neuropathies.",Redox biology
Biological underpinnings of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder: focusing on genetics and epigenetics.,"Certain individuals are more susceptible to stress and trauma, as well as the physical and mental health consequences following such exposure, including risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This differing vulnerability is likely to be influenced by genetic predisposition and specific characteristics of the stress itself (nature, intensity and duration), as well as epigenetic mechanisms. In this review we provide an overview of research findings in this field. We highlight some of the key genetic risk factors identified for PTSD, and the evidence that epigenetic processes might play a role in the biological response to trauma, as well as being potential biomarkers of PTSD risk. We also discuss important considerations for future research in this area.",Epigenomics
Exosomes-Loaded Electroconductive Hydrogel Synergistically Promotes Tissue Repair after Spinal Cord Injury via Immunoregulation and Enhancement of Myelinated Axon Growth.,"Electroconductive hydrogels are very attractive candidates for accelerated spinal cord injury (SCI) repair because they match the electrical and mechanical properties of neural tissue. However, electroconductive hydrogel implantation can potentially aggravate inflammation, and hinder its repair efficacy. Bone marrow stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-exosomes) have shown immunomodulatory and tissue regeneration effects, therefore, neural tissue-like electroconductive hydrogels loaded with BMSC-exosomes are developed for the synergistic treatment of SCI. These exosomes-loaded electroconductive hydrogels modulate microglial M2 polarization via the NF-κB pathway, and synergistically enhance neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) while inhibiting astrocyte differentiation, and also increase axon outgrowth via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, exosomes combined electroconductive hydrogels significantly decrease the number of CD68-positive microglia, enhance local NSCs recruitment, and promote neuronal and axonal regeneration, resulting in significant functional recovery at the early stage in an SCI mouse model. Hence, the findings of this study demonstrate that the combination of electroconductive hydrogels and BMSC-exosomes is a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI repair.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"
Epigenomic Dysregulation in Schizophrenia: In Search of Disease Etiology and Biomarkers.,"Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a complex array of signs and symptoms that causes very significant disability in young people. While schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, with heritability around 80%, there is also a very significant range of environmental exposures and stressors that have been implicated in disease development and neuropathology, such as maternal immune infection, obstetric complications, childhood trauma and cannabis exposure. It is postulated that epigenetic factors, as well as regulatory non-coding RNAs, mediate the effects of these environmental stressors. In this review, we explore the most well-known epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation and histone modification, along with emerging RNA mediators of epigenomic state, including miRNAs and lncRNAs, and discuss their collective potential for involvement in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia implicated through the postmortem analysis of brain tissue. Given that peripheral tissues, such as blood, saliva, and olfactory epithelium have the same genetic composition and are exposed to many of the same environmental exposures, we also examine some studies supporting the application of peripheral tissues for epigenomic biomarker discovery in schizophrenia. Finally, we provide some perspective on how these biomarkers may be utilized to capture a signature of past events that informs future treatment.",Cells
Mechanisms of exercise as a preventative measure to muscle wasting.,"Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in healthy individuals and it has important roles in health beyond voluntary movement. The overall mass and energy requirements of skeletal muscle require it to be metabolically active and flexible to multiple energy substrates. The tissue has evolved to be largely load dependent and it readily adapts in a number of positive ways to repetitive overload, such as various forms of exercise training. However, unloading from extended bed rest and/or metabolic derangements in response to trauma, acute illness, or severe pathology, commonly results in rapid muscle wasting. Decline in muscle mass contributes to multimorbidity, reduces function, and exerts a substantial, negative impact on the quality of life. The principal mechanisms controlling muscle mass have been well described and these cellular processes are intricately regulated by exercise. Accordingly, exercise has shown great promise and efficacy in preventing or slowing muscle wasting through changes in molecular physiology, organelle function, cell signaling pathways, and epigenetic regulation. In this review, we focus on the role of exercise in altering the molecular landscape of skeletal muscle in a manner that improves or maintains its health and function in the presence of unloading or disease.epigenetics; exercise; muscle wasting; resistance training; skeletal muscle.",American journal of physiology.

"Critical Windows: Exploring the Association Between Perinatal Trauma, Epigenetics, and Chronic Pain.","Chronic pain is highly prevalent and burdensome, affecting millions of people worldwide. Although it emerges at any point in life, it often manifests in adolescence. Given that adolescence is a unique developmental period, additional strains associated with persistent and often idiopathic pain lead to significant long-term consequences. While there is no singular cause for the chronification of pain, epigenetic modifications that lead to neural reorganization may underpin central sensitization and subsequent manifestation of pain hypersensitivity. Epigenetic processes are particularly active during the prenatal and early postnatal years. We demonstrate how exposure to various traumas, such as intimate partner violence while in utero or adverse childhood experiences, can significantly influence epigenetic regulation within the brain and in turn modify pain-related processes. We provide compelling evidence that the burden of chronic pain is likely initiated early in life, often being transmitted from mother to offspring. We also highlight two promising prophylactic strategies, oxytocin administration and probiotic use, that have the potential to attenuate the epigenetic consequences of early adversity. Overall, we advance understanding of the causal relationship between trauma and adolescent chronic pain by highlighting epigenetic mechanisms that underlie this transmission of risk, ultimately informing how to prevent this rising epidemic.","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry"
A road map for understanding molecular and genetic determinants of osteoporosis.,"Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disorder characterized by low bone mineral density and an increased risk of fracture, termed osteoporotic fracture. Notably, bone mineral density, osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture are highly heritable; however, determining the genetic architecture, and especially the underlying genomic and molecular mechanisms, of osteoporosis in vivo in humans is still challenging. In addition to susceptibility loci identified in genome-wide association studies, advances in various omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics, have all been applied to dissect the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. However, each technology individually cannot capture the entire view of the disease pathology and thus fails to comprehensively identify the underlying pathological molecular mechanisms, especially the regulatory and signalling mechanisms. A change to the status quo calls for integrative multi-omics and inter-omics analyses with approaches in 'systems genetics and genomics'. In this Review, we highlight findings from genome-wide association studies and studies using various omics technologies individually to identify mechanisms of osteoporosis. Furthermore, we summarize current studies of data integration to understand, diagnose and inform the treatment of osteoporosis. The integration of multiple technologies will provide a road map to illuminate the complex pathogenesis of osteoporosis, especially from molecular functional aspects, in vivo in humans.",Nature reviews.

Valproic Acid and Epilepsy: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Evidences.,"After more than a century from its discovery, valproic acid (VPA) still represents one of the most efficient antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Pre and post-synaptic effects of VPA depend on a very broad spectrum of actions, including the regulation of ionic currents and the facilitation of GABAergic over glutamatergic transmission. As a result, VPA indirectly modulates neurotransmitter release and strengthens the threshold for seizure activity. However, even though participating to the anticonvulsant action, such mechanisms seem to have minor impact on epileptogenesis. Nonetheless, VPA has been reported to exert anti-epileptogenic effects. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone deacetylases (HDACs), BDNF and GDNF modulation are pivotal to orientate neurons toward a neuroprotective status and promote dendritic spines organization. From such broad spectrum of actions comes constantly enlarging indications for VPA. It represents a drug of choice in child and adult with epilepsy, with either general or focal seizures, and is a consistent and safe IV option in generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Moreover, since VPA modulates DNA transcription through HDACs, recent evidences point to its use as an anti-nociceptive in migraine prophylaxis, and, even more interestingly, as a positive modulator of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Furthermore, VPA-induced neuroprotection is under investigation for benefit in stroke and traumatic brain injury. Hence, VPA has still got its place in epilepsy, and yet deserves attention for its use far beyond neurological diseases. In this review, we aim to highlight, with a translational intent, the molecular basis and the clinical indications of VPA.",Current neuropharmacology
Epigenetics in radiation-induced fibrosis.,"Radiotherapy is a major cancer treatment option but dose-limiting side effects such as late-onset fibrosis in the irradiated tissue severely impair quality of life in cancer survivors. Efforts to explain radiation-induced fibrosis, for example, by genetic variation remained largely inconclusive. Recently published molecular analyses on radiation response and fibrogenesis showed a prominent role of epigenetic gene regulation. This review summarizes the current knowledge on epigenetic modifications in fibrotic disease and radiation response, and it points out the important role for epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, microRNAs and histone modifications in the development of this disease. The synopsis illustrates the complexity of radiation-induced fibrosis and reveals the need for investigations to further unravel its molecular mechanisms. Importantly, epigenetic changes are long-term determinants of gene expression and can therefore support those mechanisms that induce and perpetuate fibrogenesis even in the absence of the initial damaging stimulus. Future work must comprise the interconnection of acute radiation response and long-lasting epigenetic effects in order to assess their role in late-onset radiation fibrosis. An improved understanding of the underlying biology is fundamental to better comprehend the origin of this disease and to improve both preventive and therapeutic strategies.",Oncogene
Major trauma and acceleration of the ageing process.,"It is well established that numerous factors can affect the rate at which we age biologically. Diet, physical activity, lifestyle and our genes all play a major role in influencing the ageing trajectory and longevity. Major trauma affects millions globally, is the major cause of death in young adults and could influence ageing processes but has largely been ignored by biogenterologists. The long-term health consequences of physical trauma are well known in the medical community, how trauma effects the ageing process at a molecular level is not. It has long been difficult to assess ageing trajectories due to the absence of a biomarker of biological rather than chronological age. Recent advances in epigenetics have helped by identifying specific DNA methylation sites as good indicators of biological age. Recent investigations into the impact of psychological trauma and the associated physical stress on accelerating ageing as measured by epigenetic drift are promising. The physical and metabolic stress which is synonymous with physical trauma may also accelerate the ageing process. We suggest that long term epigenetic profiling is required to understand to what degree the ageing trajectory is altered by trauma, which will in turn add support for the development of novel therapies to improve health outcomes for survivors of traumatic injury.",Ageing research reviews
A nerve injury-specific long noncoding RNA promotes neuropathic pain by increasing Ccl2 expression.,"Maladaptive changes of nerve injury-associated genes in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are critical for neuropathic pain genesis. Emerging evidence supports the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating gene transcription. Here we identified a conserved lncRNA, named nerve injury-specific lncRNA (NIS-lncRNA) for its upregulation in injured DRGs exclusively in response to nerve injury. This upregulation was triggered by nerve injury-induced increase in DRG ELF1, a transcription factor that bound to the NIS-lncRNA promoter. Blocking this upregulation attenuated nerve injury-induced CCL2 increase in injured DRGs and nociceptive hypersensitivity during the development and maintenance periods of neuropathic pain. Mimicking NIS-lncRNA upregulation elevated CCL2 expression, increased CCL2-mediated excitability in DRG neurons, and produced neuropathic pain symptoms. Mechanistically, NIS-lncRNA recruited more binding of the RNA-interacting protein FUS to the Ccl2 promoter and augmented Ccl2 transcription in injured DRGs. Thus, NIS-lncRNA participates in neuropathic pain likely by promoting FUS-triggered DRG Ccl2 expression and may be a potential target in neuropathic pain management.",The Journal of clinical investigation
Molecular Mechanisms of Neuroprotection by Ketone Bodies and Ketogenic Diet in Cerebral Ischemia and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Ketone bodies (KBs), such as acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, serve as crucial alternative energy sources during glucose deficiency. KBs, generated through ketogenesis in the liver, are metabolized into acetyl-CoA in extrahepatic tissues, entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain for ATP production. Reduced glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction correlate with increased neuronal death and brain damage during cerebral ischemia and neurodegeneration. Both KBs and the ketogenic diet (KD) demonstrate neuroprotective effects by orchestrating various cellular processes through metabolic and signaling functions. They enhance mitochondrial function, mitigate oxidative stress and apoptosis, and regulate epigenetic and post-translational modifications of histones and non-histone proteins. Additionally, KBs and KD contribute to reducing neuroinflammation and modulating autophagy, neurotransmission systems, and gut microbiome. This review aims to explore the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the neuroprotective effects of KBs and KD against brain damage in cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",International journal of molecular sciences
Borderline personality - from psychoanalysis to epigenetics. Biological basis of attachment.,"In terms of object relations theory, borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a structural abnormality of identity, conflicting representations of self and others, and disorganization of attachment - a construct rooted in an individual's early experiences and central to the relationships established later in life. A special role in the formation of attachment style is attributed to the relationship with the caregiver and to difficult experiences or traumas from early developmental stages. These experiences not only provide the psychological basis for the development of an insecure attachment style, but also leave a biological mark in the body in the form of epigenetic modifications. Although research on epigenetic modifications in BPD is scarce, a growing body of evidence supports the importance of oxytocin - the ""social peptide"" underlying attachment - in the etiology of BPD. We believe that the study of epigenetic modifications that affect the action of oxytocin in the BPD clinical population will provide a better understanding of the basis and process of development of the disorder, as well as provide a therapeutic direction to work effectively in the major areas of BPD.",Psychiatria polska
Recent Genetics and Epigenetics Approaches to PTSD.,"Following a life-threatening traumatic exposure, about 10% of those exposed are at considerable risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a severe and disabling syndrome characterized by uncontrollable intrusive memories, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal in addition to impaired cognition and negative emotion symptoms.

Single-cell and spatial atlases of spinal cord injury in the Tabulae Paralytica.,"Here, we introduce the Tabulae Paralytica-a compilation of four atlases of spinal cord injury (SCI) comprising a single-nucleus transcriptome atlas of half a million cells, a multiome atlas pairing transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements within the same nuclei, and two spatial transcriptomic atlases of the injured spinal cord spanning four spatial and temporal dimensions. We integrated these atlases into a common framework to dissect the molecular logic that governs the responses to injury within the spinal cord<sup>1</sup>. The Tabulae Paralytica uncovered new biological principles that dictate the consequences of SCI, including conserved and divergent neuronal responses to injury; the priming of specific neuronal subpopulations to upregulate circuit-reorganizing programs after injury; an inverse relationship between neuronal stress responses and the activation of circuit reorganization programs; the necessity of re-establishing a tripartite neuroprotective barrier between immune-privileged and extra-neural environments after SCI and a failure to form this barrier in old mice. We leveraged the Tabulae Paralytica to develop a rejuvenative gene therapy that re-established this tripartite barrier, and restored the natural recovery of walking after paralysis in old mice. The Tabulae Paralytica provides a window into the pathobiology of SCI, while establishing a framework for integrating multimodal, genome-scale measurements in four dimensions to study biology and medicine.",Nature
Spinal cord repair is modulated by the neurogenic factor Hb-egf under direction of a regeneration-associated enhancer.,"Unlike adult mammals, zebrafish regenerate spinal cord tissue and recover locomotor ability after a paralyzing injury. Here, we find that ependymal cells in zebrafish spinal cords produce the neurogenic factor Hb-egfa upon transection injury. Animals with hb-egfa mutations display defective swim capacity, axon crossing, and tissue bridging after spinal cord transection, associated with disrupted indicators of neuron production. Local recombinant human HB-EGF delivery alters ependymal cell cycling and tissue bridging, enhancing functional regeneration. Epigenetic profiling reveals a tissue regeneration enhancer element (TREE) linked to hb-egfa that directs gene expression in spinal cord injuries. Systemically delivered recombinant AAVs containing this zebrafish TREE target gene expression to crush injuries of neonatal, but not adult, murine spinal cords. Moreover, enhancer-based HB-EGF delivery by AAV administration improves axon densities after crush injury in neonatal cords. Our results identify Hb-egf as a neurogenic factor necessary for innate spinal cord regeneration and suggest strategies to improve spinal cord repair in mammals.",Nature communications
A phase 2 study of thalidomide for the treatment of radiation-induced blood-brain barrier injury.,"Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is a debilitating sequela after radiotherapy to treat head and neck cancer, and 20 to 30% of patients with RIBI fail to respond to or have contraindications to the first-line treatments of bevacizumab and corticosteroids. Here, we reported a Simon's minmax two-stage, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03208413) to assess the efficacy of thalidomide in patients with RIBI who were unresponsive to or had contraindications to bevacizumab and corticosteroid therapies. The trial met its primary endpoint, with 27 of 58 patients enrolled showing ≥25% reduction in the volume of cerebral edema on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-magnetic resonance imaging (FLAIR-MRI) after treatment (overall response rate, 46.6%; 95% CI, 33.3 to 60.1%). Twenty-five (43.1%) patients demonstrated a clinical improvement based on the Late Effects Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT/SOMA) scale, and 36 (62.1%) experienced cognitive improvement based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. In a mouse model of RIBI, thalidomide restored the blood-brain barrier and cerebral perfusion, which were attributed to the functional rescue of pericytes secondary to elevation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) expression by thalidomide. Our data thus demonstrate the therapeutic potential of thalidomide for the treatment of radiation-induced cerebral vasculature impairment.",Science translational medicine

HIF-1α/JMJD1A signaling regulates inflammation and oxidative stress following hyperglycemia and hypoxia-induced vascular cell injury.,"Endothelial cell (EC) injury accelerates the progression of diabetic macrovascular complications. Hypoxia is an important cause of EC injury. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is an important hypoxia regulatory protein. Our previous studies showed that high-glucose and hypoxic conditions could upregulate HIF-1α expression and enhance EC inflammatory injury, independently of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway. However, it is not clear whether HIF-1α plays a role in vascular disease through epigenetic-related mechanisms.",Cellular & molecular biology letters
Histone methyltransferase Ezh2 coordinates mammalian axon regeneration via regulation of key regenerative pathways.,"Current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and neural injuries face major challenges, primarily due to the diminished regenerative capacity of neurons in the mammalian CNS as they mature. Here, we investigated the role of Ezh2, a histone methyltransferase, in regulating mammalian axon regeneration. We found that Ezh2 declined in the mouse nervous system during maturation but was upregulated in adult dorsal root ganglion neurons following peripheral nerve injury to facilitate spontaneous axon regeneration. In addition, overexpression of Ezh2 in retinal ganglion cells in the CNS promoted optic nerve regeneration via both histone methylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Further investigation revealed that Ezh2 fostered axon regeneration by orchestrating the transcriptional silencing of genes governing synaptic function and those inhibiting axon regeneration, while concurrently activating various factors that support axon regeneration. Notably, we demonstrated that GABA transporter 2, encoded by Slc6a13, acted downstream of Ezh2 to control axon regeneration.

Epigenetic Alterations Associated with War Trauma and Childhood Maltreatment.,"Survivors of war trauma or childhood maltreatment are at increased risk for trauma-spectrum disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, traumatic stress has been associated with alterations in the neuroendocrine and the immune system, enhancing the risk for physical diseases. Traumatic experiences might even affect psychological as well as biological parameters in the next generation, i.e. traumatic stress might have transgenerational effects. This article outlines how epigenetic processes, which represent a pivotal biological mechanism for dynamic adaptation to environmental challenges, might contribute to the explanation of the long-lasting and transgenerational effects of trauma. In particular, epigenetic alterations in genes regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis as well as the immune system have been observed in survivors of childhood and adult trauma. These changes could result in enduring alterations of the stress response as well as the physical health risk. Furthermore, the effects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next generation by parental distress and the pre- and postnatal environment, as well as by epigenetic marks transmitted via the germline. While epigenetic research has a high potential of advancing our understanding of the consequences of trauma, the findings have to be interpreted with caution, as epigenetics only represent one piece of a complex puzzle of interacting biological and environmental factors.

Epigenetics and its implications for Psychology.,Epigenetics is changing the widely accepted linear conception of genome function by explaining how environmental and psychological factors regulate the activity of our genome without involving changes in the DNA sequence. Research has identified epigenetic mechanisms mediating between environmental and psychological factors that contribute to normal and abnormal behavioral development.,Psicothema
Epigenetic regulation of bone mass.,"Osteoporosis, characterised by low bone mass, poor bone structure, and an increased risk of fracture, is a major public health problem. There is increasing evidence that the influence of the environment on gene expression, through epigenetic processes, contributes to variation in BMD and fracture risk across the lifecourse. Such epigenetic processes include DNA methylation, histone and chromatin modifications and non-coding RNAs. Examples of associations with phenotype include DNA methylation in utero linked to maternal vitamin D status, and to methylation of target genes such as OPG and RANKL being associated with osteoporosis in later life. Epigenome-wide association studies and multi-omics technologies have further revealed susceptibility loci, and histone acetyltransferases, deacetylases and methylases are being considered as therapeutic targets. This review encompasses recent advances in our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of bone mass and osteoporosis development, and outlines possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarker applications.",Best practice & research.

Nerve trauma-caused downregulation of opioid receptors in primary afferent neurons: Molecular mechanisms and potential managements.,"Neuropathic pain is the most common clinical disorder destroying the quality of patient life and leading to a marked economic and social burden. Opioids are still last option for pharmacological treatment of this disorder, but their antinociceptive effects are limited in part due to the downregulation of opioid receptors in the primary afferent neurons after peripheral nerve trauma. How this downregulation occurs is not completely understood, but recent studies have demonstrated that peripheral nerve trauma drives the alterations in epigenetic modifications (including DNA methylation, histone methylation and mciroRNAs), expression of transcription factors, post-transcriptional modifications (e.g., RNA methylation) and protein translation initiation in the neurons of nerve trauma-related dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and that these alternations may be associated with nerve trauma-caused downregulation of DRG opioid receptors. This review presents how opioid receptors are downregulated in the DRG after peripheral nerve trauma, specifically focusing on distinct molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional and translational processes. This review also discusses how this downregulation contributes to the induction and maintenance of neuropathic pain. A deeper understanding of these molecular mechanisms likely provides a novel avenue for prevention and/or treatment of neuropathic pain.",Experimental neurology
Male-mediated developmental toxicity.,"Male-mediated developmental toxicity has been of concern for many years. The public became aware of male-mediated developmental toxicity in the early 1990s when it was reported that men working at Sellafield might be causing leukemia in their children. Human and animal studies have contributed to our current understanding of male-mediated effects. Animal studies in the 1980s and 1990s suggested that genetic damage after radiation and chemical exposure might be transmitted to offspring. With the increasing understanding that there is histone retention and modification, protamine incorporation into the chromatin and DNA methylation in mature sperm and that spermatozoal RNA transcripts can play important roles in the epigenetic state of sperm, heritable studies began to be viewed differently. Recent reports using molecular approaches have demonstrated that DNA damage can be transmitted to babies from smoking fathers, and expanded simple tandem repeats minisatellite mutations were found in the germline of fathers who were exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. In epidemiological studies, it is possible to clarify whether damage is transmitted to the sons after exposure of the fathers. Paternally transmitted damage to the offspring is now recognized as a complex issue with genetic as well as epigenetic components.",Asian journal of andrology
"Epigenetics as a key link between psychosocial stress and aging: concepts, evidence, mechanisms .","Psychosocial stress-especially when chronic, excessive, or occurring early in life-has been associated with accelerated aging and increased disease risk. With rapid aging of the world population, the need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms is pressing, now more so than ever. Among molecular mechanisms linking stress and aging, the present article reviews evidence on the role of epigenetics, biochemical processes that can be set into motion by stressors and in turn influence genomic function and complex phenotypes, including aging-related outcomes. The article further provides a conceptual mechanistic framework on how stress may drive epigenetic changes at susceptible genomic sites, thereby exerting systems-level effects on the aging epigenome while also regulating the expression of molecules implicated in aging-related processes. This emerging evidence, together with work examining related biological processes, begins to shed light on the epigenetic and, more broadly, molecular underpinnings of the long-hypothesized connection between stress and aging. .",Dialogues in clinical neuroscience
Epigenetic Alterations in Sports-Related Injuries.,"It is a well-known fact that physical activity benefits people of all age groups. However, highly intensive training, maladaptation, improper equipment, and lack of sufficient rest lead to contusions and sports-related injuries. From the perspectives of sports professionals and those performing regular-amateur sports activities, it is important to maintain proper levels of training, without encountering frequent injuries. The bodily responses to physical stress and intensive physical activity are detected on many levels. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone protein methylation, acetylation, and miRNA expression occur in response to environmental changes and play fundamental roles in the regulation of cellular activities. In the current review, we summarise the available knowledge on epigenetic alterations present in tissues and organs (e.g., muscles, the brain, tendons, and bones) as a consequence of sports-related injuries. Epigenetic mechanism observations have the potential to become useful tools in sports medicine, as predictors of approaching pathophysiological alterations and injury biomarkers that have already taken place.",Genes
Biological Embedding of Early-Life Adversity and a Scoping Review of the Evidence for Intergenerational Epigenetic Transmission of Stress and Trauma in Humans.,"Severe or chronic stress and trauma can have a detrimental impact on health. Evidence suggests that early-life adversity can become biologically embedded and has the potential to influence health outcomes decades later. Epigenetics is one mechanism that has been implicated in these long-lasting effects. Observational studies in humans indicate that the effects of stress could even persist across generations, although whether or not epigenetic mechanisms are involved remains under debate. Here, we provide an overview of studies in animals and humans that demonstrate the effects of early-life stress on DNA methylation, one of the most widely studied epigenetic mechanisms, and summarize findings from animal models demonstrating the involvement of epigenetics in the transmission of stress across generations. We then describe the results of a scoping review to determine the extent to which the terms intergenerational or transgenerational have been used in human studies investigating the transmission of trauma and stress via epigenetic mechanisms. We end with a discussion of key areas for future research to advance understanding of the role of epigenetics in the legacy effects of stress and trauma.",Genes
MicroRNAs in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can develop following exposure to or witnessing of a (potentially) threatening event. A critical issue is to pinpoint the (neuro)biological mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to stress-related disorder such as PTSD, which develops in the minority of ~15% of individuals exposed to trauma. Over the last few years, a first wave of epigenetic studies has been performed in an attempt to identify the molecular underpinnings of the long-lasting behavioral and mental effects of trauma exposure. The potential roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNAs (miRNAs) in moderating or mediating the impact of severe stress and trauma are increasingly gaining attention. To date, most studies focusing on the roles of miRNAs in PTSD have, however, been completed in animals, using cross-sectional study designs and focusing almost exclusively on subjects with susceptible phenotypes. Therefore, there is a strong need for new research comprising translational and cross-species approaches that use longitudinal designs for studying trajectories of change contrasting susceptible and resilient subjects. The present review offers a comprehensive overview of available studies of miRNAs in PTSD and discusses the current challenges, pitfalls, and future perspectives of this field.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences
Epigenetic regulation in radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.,"Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) is a common and serious adverse effect of radiotherapy for thoracic tumors, which occurs in the irreversible stage of radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) >6 months after irradiation. It is characterized by progressive and irreversible destruction of lung tissue and deterioration of lung function, which may impair quality of life and lead to respiratory failure and death. We hope this will draw attention to the involvement of epigenetics in the regulation of RIPF.",International journal of radiation biology
"Epigenetics of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Current Evidence, Challenges, and Future Directions.","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a stress-related psychiatric disorder that is thought to emerge from complex interactions among traumatic events and multiple genetic factors. Epigenetic regulation lies at the heart of these interactions and mediates the lasting effects of the environment on gene regulation. An increasing body of evidence in human subjects with PTSD supports a role for epigenetic regulation of distinct genes and pathways in the pathogenesis of PTSD. The role of epigenetic regulation is further supported by studies examining fear conditioning in rodent models. Although this line of research offers an exciting outlook for future epigenetic research in PTSD, important limitations include the tissue specificity of epigenetic modifications, the phenomenologic definition of the disorder, and the challenge of translating molecular evidence across species. These limitations call for studies that combine data from postmortem human brain tissue and animal models, assess longitudinal epigenetic changes in living subjects, and examine dimensional phenotypes in addition to diagnoses. Moreover, examining the environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors that promote resilience to trauma may lead to important advances in the field.",Biological psychiatry
Epigenetic mechanisms activated by childhood adversity.,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) impair health and life expectancy and may result in an epigenetic signature that drives increased morbidity primed during early stages of life. This literature review focuses on the current evidence for epigenetic-mediated programming of brain and immune function resulting from ACE. To address this aim, a total of 88 articles indexed in PubMed before August 2019 concerning ACE and epigenetics were surveyed. Current evidence partially supports epigenetic programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, but convincingly shows that ACE impairs immune function. Additionally, the needs and challenges that face this area are discussed in order to provide a framework that may help to clarify the role of epigenetics in the long-lasting effects of ACE.",Epigenomics
The role of mitochondria in myocardial damage caused by energy metabolism disorders: From mechanisms to therapeutics.,"Myocardial damage is the most serious pathological consequence of cardiovascular diseases and an important reason for their high mortality. In recent years, because of the high prevalence of systemic energy metabolism disorders (e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome), complications of myocardial damage caused by these disorders have attracted widespread attention. Energy metabolism disorders are independent of traditional injury-related risk factors, such as ischemia, hypoxia, trauma, and infection. An imbalance of myocardial metabolic flexibility and myocardial energy depletion are usually the initial changes of myocardial injury caused by energy metabolism disorders, and abnormal morphology and functional destruction of the mitochondria are their important features. Specifically, mitochondria are the centers of energy metabolism, and recent evidence has shown that decreased mitochondrial function, caused by an imbalance in mitochondrial quality control, may play a key role in myocardial injury caused by energy metabolism disorders. Under chronic energy stress, mitochondria undergo pathological fission, while mitophagy, mitochondrial fusion, and biogenesis are inhibited, and mitochondrial protein balance and transfer are disturbed, resulting in the accumulation of nonfunctional and damaged mitochondria. Consequently, damaged mitochondria lead to myocardial energy depletion and the accumulation of large amounts of reactive oxygen species, further aggravating the imbalance in mitochondrial quality control and forming a vicious cycle. In addition, impaired mitochondria coordinate calcium homeostasis imbalance, and epigenetic alterations participate in the pathogenesis of myocardial damage. These pathological changes induce rapid progression of myocardial damage, eventually leading to heart failure or sudden cardiac death. To intervene more specifically in the myocardial damage caused by metabolic disorders, we need to understand the specific role of mitochondria in this context in detail. Accordingly, promising therapeutic strategies have been proposed. We also summarize the existing therapeutic strategies to provide a reference for clinical treatment and developing new therapies.",Free radical biology & medicine
Epigenetic Mechanisms of Traumatic Brain Injuries.,"Of all types of injuries, traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are most likely to result in death or permanent physical or mental disabilities. With the increased frequency of military operations, terror attacks, sports activities, and road mishaps, TBIs are increasingly becoming a serious public health concern. Patients who meet with moderate-to-severe TBI suffer from a constellation of cognitive deficits and phenotypes due to diffuse axonal injury. On the contrary, minimal TBI precipitates in long-term behavioral complications commonly referred to as post-traumatic stress disorders, which consist of depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and so on. During the last decade, epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone posttranslational modifications, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNAs, have received reasonable attention by scientists studying the neurobiology of TBI. Chromatin remodeling sculpted by various epigenetic factors in different parts of the brain controls many intricate processes involved in important neural functions. Although stable and dogmatic, the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications has attracted special attention for their emerging potential in therapeutic development. Herein, we offer an overview of recent observations on epigenetic pathways that are likely involved in shaping neural function and maintain the state of neuropathology in response to traumatic events.",Progress in molecular biology and translational science
Advancing burn wound treatment: exploring hydrogel as a transdermal drug delivery system.,"Burn injuries are prevalent and life-threatening forms that contribute significantly to mortality rates due to associated wound infections. The management of burn wounds presents substantial challenges. Hydrogel exhibits tremendous potential as an ideal alternative to traditional wound dressings such as gauze. This is primarily attributed to its three-dimensional (3D) crosslinked polymer network, which possesses a high water content, fostering a moist environment that supports effective burn wound healing. Additionally, hydrogel facilitates the penetration of loaded therapeutic agents throughout the wound surface, combating burn wound pathogens through the hydration effect and thereby enhancing the healing process. However, the presence of eschar formation on burn wounds obstructs the passive diffusion of therapeutics, impairing the efficacy of hydrogel as a wound dressing, particularly in cases of severe burns involving deeper tissue damage. This review focuses on exploring the potential of hydrogel as a carrier for transdermal drug delivery in burn wound treatment. Furthermore, strategies aimed at enhancing the transdermal delivery of therapeutic agents from hydrogel to optimize burn wound healing are also discussed.",Drug delivery
Epigenetics of neural repair following spinal cord injury.,"Spinal cord injury results from an insult inflicted on the spinal cord that usually encompasses its 4 major functions (motor, sensory, autonomic, and reflex). The type of deficits resulting from spinal cord injury arise from primary insult, but their long-term severity is due to a multitude of pathophysiological processes during the secondary phase of injury. The failure of the mammalian spinal cord to regenerate and repair is often attributed to the very feature that makes the central nervous system special-it becomes so highly specialized to perform higher functions that it cannot effectively reactivate developmental programs to re-build novel circuitry to restore function after injury. Added to this is an extensive gliotic and immune response that is essential for clearance of cellular debris, but also lays down many obstacles that are detrimental to regeneration. Here, we discuss how the mature chromatin state of different central nervous system cells (neural, glial, and immune) may contribute to secondary pathophysiology, and how restoring silenced developmental gene expression by altering histone acetylation could stall secondary damage and contribute to novel approaches to stimulate endogenous repair.",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics
Kdm6a-CNN1 axis orchestrates epigenetic control of trauma-induced spinal cord microvascular endothelial cell senescence to balance neuroinflammation for improved neurological repair.,"Cellular senescence assumes pivotal roles in various diseases through the secretion of proinflammatory factors. Despite extensive investigations into vascular senescence associated with aging and degenerative diseases, the molecular mechanisms governing microvascular endothelial cell senescence induced by traumatic stress, particularly its involvement in senescence-induced inflammation, remain insufficiently elucidated. In this study, we present a comprehensive demonstration and characterization of microvascular endothelial cell senescence induced by spinal cord injury (SCI). Lysine demethylase 6A (Kdm6a), commonly known as UTX, emerges as a crucial regulator of cell senescence in injured spinal cord microvascular endothelial cells (SCMECs). Upregulation of UTX induces senescence in SCMECs, leading to an amplified release of proinflammatory factors, specifically the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components, thereby modulating the inflammatory microenvironment. Conversely, the deletion of UTX in endothelial cells shields SCMECs against senescence, mitigates the release of proinflammatory SASP factors, and promotes neurological functional recovery after SCI. UTX forms an epigenetic regulatory axis by binding to calponin 1 (CNN1), orchestrating trauma-induced SCMECs senescence and SASP secretion, thereby influencing neuroinflammation and neurological functional repair. Furthermore, local delivery of a senolytic drug reduces senescent SCMECs and suppresses proinflammatory SASP secretion, reinstating a local regenerative microenvironment and enhancing functional repair after SCI. In conclusion, targeting the UTX-CNN1 epigenetic axis to prevent trauma-induced SCMECs senescence holds the potential to inhibit SASP secretion, alleviate neuroinflammation, and provide a novel treatment strategy for SCI repair.",Bone research
S100A8 regulates autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in microglia after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Targeting microglial activation has been shown to ameliorate early brain injury (EBI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Ferroptosis is a new form of programmed cell death after SAH, but these molecular features were not recognized as evidence of microglial function so far. In this study, we constructed microglial S100A8-specific knockdown and established the SAH model in vivo and in vitro. Multi-technology strategies, including high throughput sequencing, adeno-associated virus gene gene-editing and several molecular biotechnologies to validate the effects of S100A8 on microglial autophagy and ferroptosis after SAH. Our results revealed that the expression of S100A8 was significantly increased in brain tissue after SAH. Targeted microglial S100A8 inhibition improved neural function and neuronal apoptosis in mice after SAH. Further mechanism exploration found that favourable effects of S100A8 depletion in EBI may be through the inhibition of microglia autophagy-dependent ferroptosis. In conclusion, S100A8 may be a potential intervention target for microglial ferroptosis in EBI after SAH.",Experimental neurology
UTX deletion promotes M2 macrophage polarization by epigenetically regulating endothelial cell-macrophage crosstalk after spinal cord injury.,"Macrophages polarized to the M2 subtype after spinal cord injury (SCI) are beneficial for promoting neurological recovery. The crosstalk between endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages is crucial for the imbalance between proinflammatory and pro-resolving responses caused by macrophage heterogeneity; however, this crosstalk is strengthened post-SCI, leading to inflammatory cascades and second damage. As a powerful means to regulate gene expression, epigenetic regulation of the interaction between immune cells and ECs in SCI is still largely unknown. Our previous research demonstrated that the histone demethylase UTX deletion in ECs (UTX<sup>-/-</sup> ECs) promotes neurological recovery, while the precise mechanism is unrevealed. Here, we discovered that UTX<sup>-/-</sup> ECs polarize macrophages toward the M2 subtype post-SCI. Macrophage deficiency could block the neurological recovery caused by the knockdown of UTX. The exosomes from UTX<sup>-/-</sup> ECs mediate this crosstalk. In addition, we found UTX, H3K27, and miR-467b-3p/Sfmbt2 promoters forming a regulatory complex that upregulates the miR-467b-3p in UTX<sup>-/-</sup> ECs. And then, miR-467b-3p transfers to macrophages by exosomes and activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling by decreasing PTEN expression, finally polarizing macrophage to the M2 subtype. This study reveals a mechanism by epigenetic regulation of ECs-macrophages crosstalk and identifies potential targets, which may provide opportunities for treating SCI.",Journal of nanobiotechnology
Exploring epigenetic strategies for the treatment of osteoporosis.,"The worldwide trend toward an aging population has resulted in a higher incidence of chronic conditions, such as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis, a prevalent skeletal disorder characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk, encompasses primary and secondary forms, each with distinct etiologies. Mechanistically, osteoporosis involves an imbalance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. Current pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, and teriparatide, aim to modulate bone turnover and preserve bone density. Hormone replacement therapy and lifestyle modifications are also recommended to manage the condition. While current medications offer therapeutic options, they are not devoid of limitations. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, in regulating gene expression during bone remodeling. The use of epigenetic drugs, or epidrugs, to target these mechanisms offers a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in osteoporosis. In this review, we comprehensively examine the recent advancements in the application of epidrugs for treating osteoporosis.",Molecular biology reports
DNA methylation-mediated Rbpjk suppression protects against fracture nonunion caused by systemic inflammation.,"Challenging skeletal repairs are frequently seen in patients experiencing systemic inflammation. To tackle the complexity and heterogeneity of the skeletal repair process, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and revealed that progenitor cells were one of the major lineages responsive to elevated inflammation and this response adversely affected progenitor differentiation by upregulation of Rbpjk in fracture nonunion. We then validated the interplay between inflammation (via constitutive activation of Ikk2, Ikk2ca) and Rbpjk specifically in progenitors by using genetic animal models. Focusing on epigenetic regulation, we identified Rbpjk as a direct target of Dnmt3b. Mechanistically, inflammation decreased Dnmt3b expression in progenitor cells, consequently leading to Rbpjk upregulation via hypomethylation within its promoter region. We also showed that Dnmt3b loss-of-function mice phenotypically recapitulated the fracture repair defects observed in Ikk2ca-transgenic mice, whereas Dnmt3b-transgenic mice alleviated fracture repair defects induced by Ikk2ca. Moreover, Rbpjk ablation restored fracture repair in both Ikk2ca mice and Dnmt3b loss-of-function mice. Altogether, this work elucidates a common mechanism involving a NF-κB/Dnmt3b/Rbpjk axis within the context of inflamed bone regeneration. Building on this mechanistic insight, we applied local treatment with epigenetically modified progenitor cells in a previously established mouse model of inflammation-mediated fracture nonunion and showed a functional restoration of bone regeneration under inflammatory conditions through an increase in progenitor differentiation potential.",The Journal of clinical investigation
Bi-directional neuro-immune dysfunction after chronic experimental brain injury.,"It is well established that traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes acute and chronic alterations in systemic immune function and that systemic immune changes contribute to posttraumatic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. However, how TBI affects bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells chronically and to what extent such changes may negatively impact innate immunity and neurological function has not been examined.",Journal of neuroinflammation
Stress and trauma: BDNF control of dendritic-spine formation and regression.,"Chronic restraint stress leads to increases in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein in some regions of the brain, e.g. the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) but decreases in other regions such as the CA3 region of the hippocampus and dendritic spine density increases or decreases in line with these changes in BDNF. Given the powerful influence that BDNF has on dendritic spine growth, these observations suggest that the fundamental reason for the direction and extent of changes in dendritic spine density in a particular region of the brain under stress is due to the changes in BDNF there. The most likely cause of these changes is provided by the stress initiated release of steroids, which readily enter neurons and alter gene expression, for example that of BDNF. Of particular interest is how glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids tend to have opposite effects on BDNF gene expression offering the possibility that differences in the distribution of their receptors and of their downstream effects might provide a basis for the differential transcription of the BDNF genes. Alternatively, differences in the extent of methylation and acetylation in the epigenetic control of BDNF transcription are possible in different parts of the brain following stress. Although present evidence points to changes in BDNF transcription being the major causal agent for the changes in spine density in different parts of the brain following stress, steroids have significant effects on downstream pathways from the TrkB receptor once it is acted upon by BDNF, including those that modulate the density of dendritic spines. Finally, although glucocorticoids play a canonical role in determining BDNF modulation of dendritic spines, recent studies have shown a role for corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) in this regard. There is considerable improvement in the extent of changes in spine size and density in rodents with forebrain specific knockout of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) even when the glucocorticoid pathways are left intact. It seems then that CRF does have a role to play in determining BDNF control of dendritic spines.",Progress in neurobiology
Osteoarthritis year in review 2020: imaging.,"This narrative ""Year in Review"" highlights a selection of articles published between January 2019 and April 2020, to be presented at the OARSI World Congress 2020 within the field of osteoarthritis (OA) imaging. Articles were obtained from a PubMed search covering the above period, utilizing a variety of relevant search terms. We then selected original and review studies on OA-related imaging in humans, particularly those with direct clinical relevance, with a focus on the knee. Topics selected encompassed clinically relevant models of early OA, particularly imaging applications on cruciate ligament rupture, as these are of direct clinical interest and provide potential opportunity to evaluate preventive therapy. Further, imaging applications on structural modification of articular tissues in patients with established OA, by non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical interventions are summarized. Finally, novel deep learning approaches to imaging are reviewed, as these facilitate implementation and scaling of quantitative imaging application in clinical trials and clinical practice. Methodological or observational studies outside these key focus areas were not included. Studies focused on biology, biomechanics, biomarkers, genetics and epigenetics, and clinical studies that did not contain an imaging component are covered in other articles within the OARSI ""Year in Review"" series. In conclusion, exciting progress has been made in clinically validating human models of early OA, and the field of automated articular tissue segmentation. Most importantly though, it has been shown that structure modification of articular cartilage is possible, and future research should focus on the translation of these structural findings to clinical benefit.",Osteoarthritis and cartilage
Epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulation of axon regeneration.,"Effective axonal regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system requires coordination of elevated intrinsic growth capacity and decreased responses to the inhibitory environment. Intrinsic regenerative capacity largely depends on the gene regulatory network and protein translation machinery. A failure to activate these pathways upon injury is underlying a lack of robust axon regeneration in the mature mammalian central nervous system. Epigenetics and epitranscriptomics are key regulatory mechanisms that shape gene expression and protein translation. Here, we provide an overview of different types of modifications on DNA, histones, and RNA, underpinning the regenerative competence of axons in the mature mammalian peripheral and central nervous systems. We highlight other non-neuronal cells and their epigenetic changes in determining the microenvironment for tissue repair and axon regeneration. We also address advancements of single-cell technology in charting transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes that may further facilitate the mechanistic understanding of differential regenerative capacity in neuronal subtypes. Finally, as epigenetic and epitranscriptomic processes are commonly affected by brain injuries and psychiatric disorders, understanding their alterations upon brain injury would provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into etiology of injury-associated-psychiatric disorders and facilitate the development of therapeutic interventions to restore brain function.",Molecular psychiatry
Ionizing radiation for maternal medical indications.,"Ionizing radiation should be considered an avoidable exposure although all pregnant women receive some radiation from their environment. The potential effect of ionizing radiation on the fetus is determined by the dose and the timing of the exposure with growing interest in the potential risks of transgenerational effects of radiation as an epigenetic phenomenon. High dosage exposure is very unlikely in routine situations such as occupational, diagnostic, or therapeutic exposures. Individual diagnostic radiation procedures (fetal dosage <50 mGy), are not associated with any increase in lethality (miscarriage or stillbirth), genetic damage, teratogenicity, growth impairment, mental retardation, or sterility. More recent modeling has suggested that a 10 mGy fetal dose is associated with an excess risk of childhood cancer risk as low as 1 in 4545, well below historical estimates.When the mother's condition necessitates diagnostic radiation it is necessary to balance the risks of the procedure with the benefits to be gained. As almost all diagnostic imaging involves doses below the 50 mGy threshold, clinically indicated investigations should not be withheld because of concerns regarding fetal radiation exposure. Even radiotherapy directed away from the abdomen or pelvis may be considered during pregnancy, if the benefits outweigh the risks and no suitable alternative is available.",Prenatal diagnosis
The intergenerational effects of early adversity.,"Early insults during critical periods of brain development, both prenatal and postnatal, can result in epigenetic changes that may impact health and behavioral outcomes over the life span and into future generations. There is ample evidence that these early stages of brain development are sensitive to various environmental insults, including malnutrition, childhood trauma, and drug exposures. The notion that such changes, both physiological and behavioral, can also carry over into subsequent generations has long been recognized, especially in the context of experimental studies. However, epigenetic mechanisms capable of explaining such phenomena were not available until relatively recently, with most of this research published only within the last decade.",Progress in molecular biology and translational science
Potential Societal and Cultural Implications of Transgenerational Epigenetic Methylation of Trauma and PTSD: Pathology or Resilience?,"Psychological trauma is unique in that it is an environmental event that could induce biological changes and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or other mood disorders in some patients. On the other hand, there may be no psychopathology (in most cases), or even sometimes post-traumatic growth and resilience. According to the DSM-5, trauma is a prerequisite for PTSD and traumatic stress disorder, but not for depressive episodes or mood disorders, or other psychiatric conditions. This paper brings attention to the preliminary literature on transgenerational inheritance due to trauma exposure and its societal and cultural implications. There is accumulating evidence that exposure to trauma can be passed transgenerationally through epigenetic inheritance leading to changes in gene expression and possible disorders or resilience. The effects of resilience from transgenerational inheritance have not been studied, but should be, for a full understanding not only of the disease risk across generations, but also of its social and cultural implications. The epigenetic pathologic effects across generations also need further studies, as the current research is preliminary; larger replications are needed for definitive and more complete understanding. I present here a glimpse of where we are, a vision of where we should go in terms of future research direction for disease risk transmission, and recommend studies of resilience and post-traumatic growth across generations, as well as other studies related to the societal implications at the population level.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine
Immunological markers that predict radiation toxicity.,"Radiotherapy is a major modality of cancer treatment responsible for a large proportion of cancer that is cured. Radiation exposure induces an inflammatory response which can be influenced by genetic, epigenetic, tumour, health and other factors which can lead to very different treatment outcomes between individuals. Molecules involved in the immunological response provide excellent potential biomarkers for the prediction of radiation-induced toxicity. The known molecular and cellular immunological responses in relation to radiation and the potential to improve cancer treatment are presented in this review. In particular, immunological biomarkers of radiation-induced fibrosis and pneumonitis in cancer radiotherapy patients are discussed.",Cancer letters
Current Advances in Corneal Stromal Stem Cell Biology and Therapeutic Applications.,"Corneal stromal stem cells (CSSCs) are of particular interest in regenerative ophthalmology, offering a new therapeutic target for corneal injuries and diseases. This review provides a comprehensive examination of CSSCs, exploring their anatomy, functions, and role in maintaining corneal integrity. Molecular markers, wound healing mechanisms, and potential therapeutic applications are discussed. Global corneal blindness, especially in more resource-limited regions, underscores the need for innovative solutions. Challenges posed by corneal defects, emphasizing the urgent need for advanced therapeutic interventions, are discussed. The review places a spotlight on exosome therapy as a potential therapy. CSSC-derived exosomes exhibit significant potential for modulating inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and addressing corneal transparency. Additionally, the rejuvenation potential of CSSCs through epigenetic reprogramming adds to the evolving regenerative landscape. The imperative for clinical trials and human studies to seamlessly integrate these strategies into practice is emphasized. This points towards a future where CSSC-based therapies, particularly leveraging exosomes, play a central role in diversifying ophthalmic regenerative medicine.",Cells
Bound Together: How Psychoanalysis Diminishes Inter-generational DNA Trauma.,"The concept of intergenerational transmission of trauma plays a fundamental role in psychoanalysis. While it is known that intergenerational trauma can be transmitted through attachment relationships, a new branch of genetics (epigenetics) has emerged to study the interaction between human behavior and changes in DNA expression. Therefore, psychoanalysis, which has proven to reduce the intergenerational transmission of trauma from a behavioral perspective, can play a positive role in regulating DNA changes caused by environmental stress. The present paper focuses on recent research suggesting a direct correlation between psychological trauma and DNA modifications. In particular, DNA changes caused by psychological trauma can be transmitted from generation to generation, validating the psychoanalytic concept of intergenerational transmission of trauma. This evidence not only supports the essential role psychoanalysis has in influencing human behavior, but also suggests that it affects not only the individuals who undergo it but their offspring, as well, via the epigenetic passage of DNA.",American journal of psychoanalysis
The Molecular Biology of Susceptibility to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Highlights of Epigenetics and Epigenomics.,"Exposure to trauma is one of the most important and prevalent risk factors for mental and physical ill-health. Excessive or prolonged stress exposure increases the risk of a wide variety of mental and physical symptoms. However, people differ strikingly in their susceptibility to develop signs and symptoms of mental illness after traumatic stress. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder affecting approximately 8% of the world's population during their lifetime, and typically develops after exposure to a traumatic event. Despite that exposure to potentially traumatizing events occurs in a large proportion of the general population, about 80-90% of trauma-exposed individuals do not develop PTSD, suggesting an inter-individual difference in vulnerability to PTSD. While the biological mechanisms underlying this differential susceptibility are unknown, epigenetic changes have been proposed to underlie the relationship between exposure to traumatic stress and the susceptibility to develop PTSD. Epigenetic mechanisms refer to environmentally sensitive modifications to DNA and RNA molecules that regulate gene transcription without altering the genetic sequence itself. In this review, we provide an overview of various molecular biological, biochemical and physiological alterations in PTSD, focusing on changes at the genomic and epigenomic level. Finally, we will discuss how current knowledge may aid us in early detection and improved management of PTSD patients.",International journal of molecular sciences
Direct Gingival Fibroblast/Osteoblast Transdifferentiation via Epigenetics.,"Alveolar bone resorption caused by trauma or periodontal diseases has represented a challenge for both dental clinicians and researchers. In this study, we evaluate the osteogenic potential of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) through a direct transdifferentiation from HGFs to functional osteoblasts via epigenetic modification and osteogenic signaling with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in vitro and in vivo. HGF treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) induced demethylation in the hypermethylated CpG islands of the osteogenic lineage marker genes RUNX2 and ALP, and subsequent BMP2 treatment successfully drove the fibroblasts to the osteoblasts' lineage. Cell morphological changes viewed under microscopy and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red S (ARS) staining confirmed the osteoblastic change mediated by epigenetic modification as did real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, which demonstrated the altered methylation patterns in the RUNX2 and ALP promoter regions and their effect on gene expression. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography (CT) analysis of in vivo mouse cell transplantation experiments showed high-density signal in the epigenetically modified HGF group; in addition, a significant amount of bone formation was observed in the transplanted material using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as well. Collectively, our results indicate that epigenetic modification permits the direct programming of HGFs into functional osteoblasts, suggesting that this approach might open a novel therapeutic avenue in alveolar bone regeneration.",Journal of dental research
NIK as a Druggable Mediator of Tissue Injury.,"NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK, MAP3K14) is best known as the apical kinase that triggers non-canonical NF-κB activation and by its role in the immune system. Recent data indicate a role for NIK expressed by non-lymphoid cells in cancer, kidney disease, liver injury, glucose homeostasis, osteosarcopenia, vascular calcification, hematopoiesis, and endothelial function. The spectrum of NIK-associated disease now ranges from immunodeficiency (when NIK is defective) to autoimmunity, cancer, sterile inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolic disease when NIK is overactive. The development of novel small-molecule NIK inhibitors has paved the way to test NIK targeting to treat disease in vivo, and may eventually lead to NIK targeting in the clinic. In addition, NIK activators are being explored for specific conditions such as myeloid leukemia.",Trends in molecular medicine
Regeneration of Zebrafish CNS: Adult Neurogenesis.,"Regeneration in the animal kingdom is one of the most fascinating problems that have allowed scientists to address many issues of fundamental importance in basic biology. However, we came to know that the regenerative capability may vary across different species. Among vertebrates, fish and amphibians are capable of regenerating a variety of complex organs through epimorphosis. Zebrafish is an excellent animal model, which can repair several organs like damaged retina, severed spinal cord, injured brain and heart, and amputated fins. The focus of the present paper is on spinal cord regeneration in adult zebrafish. We intend to discuss our current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) that allows formation of proliferating progenitors and controls neurogenesis, which involve changes in epigenetic and transcription programs. Unlike mammals, zebrafish retains radial glia, a nonneuronal cell type in their adult central nervous system. Injury induced proliferation involves radial glia which proliferate, transcribe embryonic genes, and can give rise to new neurons. Recent technological development of exquisite molecular tools in zebrafish, such as cell ablation, lineage analysis, and novel and substantial microarray, together with advancement in stem cell biology, allowed us to investigate how progenitor cells contribute to the generation of appropriate structures and various underlying mechanisms like reprogramming.",Neural plasticity
Predicting Radiation-Induced Lung Injury in Patients With Lung Cancer: Challenges and Opportunities.,"Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is one of the main dose-limiting toxicities in radiation therapy (RT) for lung cancer. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients show signs of RILI of variable severity. The reason for the wide range of RILI severity and the mechanisms underlying its development are only partially understood. A number of clinical risk factors have been identified that can aid in clinical decision making. Technological advancements in RT and the use of strict organ-at-risk dose constraints have helped to reduce RILI. Predicting patients at risk for RILI may be further improved with a combination of cytokine assessments, γH2AX-assays in leukocytes, or epigenetic markers. A complicating factor is the lack of an objective definition of RILI. Tools such as computed tomography densitometry, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography uptake, changes in lung function measurements, and exhaled breath analysis can be implemented to better define and quantify RILI. This can aid in the search for new biomarkers, which can be accelerated by omics techniques, single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, and advances in patient-specific in vitro cell culture models. An objective quantification of RILI combined with these novel techniques can aid in the development of biomarkers to better predict patients at risk and allow personalized treatment decisions.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"
Experiences of Trauma and DNA Methylation Profiles among African American Mothers and Children.,"Potentially traumatic experiences have been associated with chronic diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as an explanation for this association. We examined the association of experiences of trauma with epigenome-wide DNAm among African American mothers (<i>n</i> = 236) and their children aged 3-5 years (<i>n</i> = 232; N = 500), using the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC) and Traumatic Events Screening Inventory-Parent Report Revised (TESI-PRR). We identified no DNAm sites significantly associated with potentially traumatic experience scores in mothers. One CpG site on the <i>ENOX1</i> gene was methylome-wide-significant in children (FDR-corrected q-value = 0.05) from the TESI-PRR. This protein-coding gene is associated with mental illness, including unipolar depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Future research should further examine the associations between childhood trauma, DNAm, and health outcomes among this understudied and high-risk group. Findings from such longitudinal research may inform clinical and translational approaches to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with epigenetic changes.",International journal of molecular sciences
The Role of DNA Methylation in Stroke Recovery.,"Epigenetic alterations affect the onset of ischemic stroke, brain injury after stroke, and mechanisms of poststroke recovery. In particular, DNA methylation can be dynamically altered by maintaining normal brain function or inducing abnormal brain damage. DNA methylation is regulated by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), which promotes methylation, DNA demethylase, which removes methyl groups, and methyl-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-binding domain (MBD) protein, which binds methylated DNA and inhibits gene expression. Investigating the effects of modulating DNMT, TET, and MBD protein expression on neuronal cell death and neurorepair in ischemic stroke and elucidating the underlying mechanisms can facilitate the formulation of therapeutic strategies for neuroprotection and promotion of neuronal recovery after stroke. In this review, we summarize the role of DNA methylation in neuroprotection and neuronal recovery after stroke according to the current knowledge regarding the effects of DNA methylation on excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and recovery after ischemic stroke. This review of the literature regarding the role of DNA methylation in neuroprotection and functional recovery after stroke may contribute to the development and application of novel therapeutic strategies for stroke.",International journal of molecular sciences
RDoC and translational perspectives on the genetics of trauma-related psychiatric disorders.,"Individuals with a history of child abuse are at high risk for depression, anxiety disorders, aggressive behavior, and substance use problems. The goal of this paper is to review studies of the genetics of these stress-related psychiatric disorders. An informative subset of studies that examined candidate gene by environment (GxE) predictors of these psychiatric problems in individuals maltreated as children is reviewed, together with extant genome wide association studies (GWAS). Emerging findings on epigenetic changes associated with adverse early experiences are also reviewed. Meta-analytic support and replicated findings are evident for several genetic risk factors; however, extant research suggests the effects are pleiotropic. Genetic factors are not associated with distinct psychiatric disorders, but rather diverse clinical phenotypes. Research also suggests adverse early life experiences are associated with changes in gene expression of multiple known candidate genes, genes involved in DNA transcription and translation, and genes necessary for brain circuitry development, with changes in gene expression reported in key brain structures implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric and substance use disorders. The finding of pleiotropy highlights the value of using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework in future studies of the genetics of stress-related psychiatric disorders, and not trying simply to link genes to multifaceted clinical syndromes, but to more limited phenotypes that map onto distinct neural circuits. Emerging work in the field of epigenetics also suggests that translational studies that integrate numerous unbiased genome-wide approaches will help to further unravel the genetics of stress-related psychiatric disorders.","American journal of medical genetics.

Altered mitochondrial epigenetics associated with subchronic doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.,"Doxorubicin (DOX), a potent and broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent, causes an irreversible, cumulative and dose-dependent cardiomyopathy that ultimately leads to congestive heart failure. The mechanisms responsible for DOX cardiotoxicity remain poorly understood, but seem to involve mitochondrial dysfunction on several levels. Epigenetics may explain a portion of this effect. Since mitochondrial dysfunction may affect the epigenetic landscape, we hypothesize that this cardiac toxicity may result from epigenetic changes related to disruption of mitochondrial function. To test this hypothesis, eight-week-old male Wistar rats (n=6/group) were administered 7 weekly injections with DOX (2mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) or saline, and sacrificed two weeks after the last injection. We assessed gene expression patterns by qPCR, global DNA methylation by ELISA, and proteome lysine acetylation status by Western blot in cardiac tissue from saline and DOX-treated rats. We show for the first time that DOX treatment decreases global DNA methylation in heart but not in liver. These differences were accompanied by alterations in mRNA expression of multiple functional gene groups. DOX disrupted cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis, as demonstrated by decreased mtDNA levels and altered transcript levels for multiple mitochondrial genes encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism and epigenetic modulation were also affected. Western blotting analyses indicated a differential protein acetylation pattern in cardiac mitochondrial fractions of DOX-treated rats compared to controls. Additionally, DOX treatment increased the activity of histone deacetylases. These results suggest an interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic alterations, which may be a primary determinant of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",Toxicology
Emerging molecular therapeutic targets for spinal cord injury.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complicated and devastating neurological disorder. Patients with SCI usually have dramatically reduced quality of life. In recent years, numerous studies have reported advances in understanding the pathophysiology of SCI and developing preclinical therapeutic strategies for SCI, including various molecular therapies, and yet there is still no cure. <b>Areas covered</b>: After SCI, tissue damage, responses and repair involve interactions among many cellular components, including neurons, axons, glia, leukocytes, and other cells. Accordingly, numerous cellular genes and molecules have become therapeutic targets for neural tissue repair, circuit reconstruction, and behavioral restoration. Here, we review the major recent advances in biological and molecular strategies to enhance neuroprotection, axon regeneration, remyelination, neuroplasticity and functional recovery in preclinical studies of SCI. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Researchers have made tremendous progress in identifying individual and combined molecular therapies in animal studies. It is very important to identify additional highly effective treatments for early neuroprotective intervention and for functionally meaningful axon regeneration and neuronal reconnections. Because multiple mechanisms contribute to the functional loss after SCI, combining the most promising approaches that target different pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms should exhibit synergistic actions for maximal functional restoration.

"Transcriptomic, Epigenomic, and Neuroanatomic Signatures Differ in Chronic Prurigo, Atopic Dermatitis, and Brachioradial Pruritus.","Scratching and scratch-induced injuries, including neuroanatomical alterations, are key characteristics of chronic pruritus entities of different origins. The aim of this study was to link gene expression (array hybridization, qPCR) with DNA methylation (array hybridization) and neuroanatomy (PGP9.5 staining) in chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG), atopic dermatitis (AD), brachioradial pruritus (BRP), and matched healthy controls. Specific signatures of gene expression and DNA methylation clearly discriminated pruritic lesional skin from nonpruritic skin in CNPG and from healthy skin of volunteers, respectively. Although intraepidermal nerve fiber density was indiscriminately reduced, the level of epidermal branching, assessed by a semiquantitative pattern analysis, differentiated the entities (CNPG > BRP > AD). Correspondingly, repellent SEMA3A showed the highest expression in AD, whereas axonal growth-promoting nerve GF was most prominent in CNPG and BRP. Overexpression of genes for nerve fiber regeneration (NELL2/NFKB/ARTN) was found in AD and CNPG but not in BRP. Our findings suggest that differential branching patterns rather than mere innervation density separate chronic itch conditions and reflect disease-specific local expression profiles. In pruritic dermatoses (AD and CNPG), nerve injury and subsequent sprouting may primarily result from chronic scratching, whereas genuine neuropathy is expected to underlie BRP.",The Journal of investigative dermatology
Exosomes as a new pain biomarker opportunity.,"Exosomes are extracellular microvesicles implicated in intercellular communication with ability to transfer cargo molecules, including protein, lipids, and nucleic acids, at both close and distant target sites. It has been shown that exosomes are implicated in physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, the interest on exosomes' role in many pain states has increased. Their involvements in pain processes have been demonstrated by studies on different chronic pain diseases, both inflammatory and neuropathic, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, neurodegenerative pathologies, complex regional pain syndrome, and peripheral nerve injury. Animal and clinical studies investigated exosomes-based treatments, showing their ability to improve painful symptoms with fewer side effects, with potential immunoprotective and anti-inflammatory effect. Specific molecular patterns characterize exosomes' cargo according to the cellular origin, epigenetic modifications, environmental state, and stressor factors. Therefore, the identification of specific cargo's profile associated to pain states may lead to recognize specific pathological states and to consider the use of exosomes as biomarkers of diseases. Furthermore, exosomes' ability to transfer information and their presence in many accessible biological fluids suggest a potential use as novel non-invasive therapeutic tools in pain field.",Molecular pain
Transgenerational Inheritance and Systemic Racism in America.,"It is well established that personal experiences of trauma, adversity, and discrimination can ""get under the skin"" and increase risk for a whole host of negative mental and physical health outcomes.

"A Synthetic Steroid 5α-Androst-3β, 5, 6β-triol Alleviates Radiation-Induced Brain Injury in Mice via Inhibiting GBP5/NF-κB/NLRP3 Signal Axis.","Radiotherapy for head and neck tumors can lead to a severe complication known as radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI). However, the underlying mechanism of RIBI development remains unclear, and limited prevention and treatment options are available. Neuroactive steroids have shown potential in treating neurological disorders. 5α-Androst-3β, 5, 6β-triol (TRIOL), a synthetic neuroprotective steroid, holds promise as a treatment candidate for RIBI patients. However, the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanism of TRIOL on RIBI treatment are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, our findings demonstrate TRIOL's potential as a neuroprotective agent against RIBI. In gamma knife irradiation mouse model, TRIOL treatment significantly reduced brain necrosis volume, microglial activation, and neuronal loss. RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, siRNA transfection, and western blotting techniques revealed that TRIOL effectively decreased microglial activation, proinflammatory cytokine release, neuron loss, and guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5) expression, along with its downstream signaling pathways NF-κB and NLRP3 activation in vitro. In summary, TRIOL effectively alleviate RIBI by inhibiting the GBP5/NF-κB/NLRP3 signal axis, reducing microglia activation and pro-inflammation cytokines release, rescuing neuron loss. This study highlights the potential of TRIOL as a novel and promising therapy drug for RIBI treatment.",Molecular neurobiology
Targets for protection and mitigation of radiation injury.,"Protection of normal tissues against toxic effects of ionizing radiation is a critical issue in clinical and environmental radiobiology. Investigations in recent decades have suggested potential targets that are involved in the protection against radiation-induced damages to normal tissues and can be proposed for mitigation of radiation injury. Emerging evidences have been shown to be in contrast to an old dogma in radiation biology; a major amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell toxicity occur during some hours to years after exposure to ionizing radiation. This can be attributed to upregulation of inflammatory and fibrosis mediators, epigenetic changes and disruption of the normal metabolism of oxygen. In the current review, we explain the cellular and molecular changes following exposure of normal tissues to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, we review potential targets that can be proposed for protection and mitigation of radiation toxicity.",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS
Epigenetic responses to heat: From adaptation to maladaptation.,"What is the topic of this review? This review outlines the history of research on epigenetic adaptations to heat exposure. The perspective taken is that adaptations reflect properties of hormesis, whereby low, repeated doses of heat induce adaptation (acclimation/acclimatization); whereas brief, life-threatening exposures can induce maladaptive responses. What advances does it highlight? The epigenetic mechanisms underlying acclimation/acclimatization comprise specific molecular programmes on histones that regulate heat shock proteins transcriptionally and protect the organism from subsequent heat exposures, even after long delays. The epigenetic signalling underlying maladaptive responses might rely, in part, on extensive changes in DNA methylation that are sustained over time and might contribute to later health challenges.",Experimental physiology
Traumatic stress and human DNA methylation: a critical review.,"Animal studies have identified persistent and functional effects of traumatic stress on the epigenome. This review discusses the clinical evidence for trauma-induced changes in DNA methylation across the life span in humans. Studies are reviewed based on reports of trauma exposure during the prenatal period (13 studies), early life (20 studies), and adulthood (ten studies). Even though it is apparent that traumatic stress influences the human epigenome, there are significant drawbacks in the existing human literature. These include a lack of longitudinal studies, methodological heterogeneity, selection of tissue type, and the influence of developmental stage and trauma type on methylation outcomes. These issues are discussed in order to present a way in which future studies can gain more insight into the functional relevance of trauma-related DNA methylation changes. Epigenetic studies investigating the detrimental effects of traumatic stress have great potential for an improved detection and treatment of trauma-related psychiatric disorders.",Epigenomics

Epigenetic Regulation of Axon Regeneration after Neural Injury.,"When peripheral axons are damaged, neuronal injury signaling pathways induce transcriptional changes that support axon regeneration and consequent functional recovery. The recent development of bioinformatics techniques has allowed for the identification of many of the regeneration-associated genes that are regulated by neural injury, yet it remains unclear how global changes in transcriptome are coordinated. In this article, we review recent studies on the epigenetic mechanisms orchestrating changes in gene expression in response to nerve injury. We highlight the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in discriminating efficient axon regeneration in the peripheral nervous system and very limited axon regrowth in the central nervous system and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting epigenetic regulators to improve neural recovery.",Molecules and cells
"You Are What Your Mother Endured: Intergenerational Epigenetics, Early Caregiving, and the Temporal Embedding of Adversity.","Environmental epigenetics has become a site of growing attention related to the intergenerational effects of stress, trauma, and adversity. This article draws on a multi-sited ethnography of epigenetic knowledge production in the United States and Canada to document how scientists conceptualize, model, and measure these experiences and their effects on children's neurodevelopmental and behavioral health. We find that scientists' efforts to identify the molecular effects of stress, trauma, and adversity results in a temporal focus on the mother-child dyad during early life. This has the effect of biologizing early childhood adversity, positioning it as a consequence of caregiving, and producing epigenetic findings that often align with individually oriented interventions rather than social and structural change. Our analysis suggests that epigenetic models of stress, trauma, and adversity therefore situate histories of oppression, inequality, and subjugation in discrete and gendered family relations, resulting in the temporal embedding of adversity during early life.",Medical anthropology quarterly
[DNA methylation in experimental ischemic brain injury].,"The enrichment of angioneurology with fundamental advances leads to the understanding of new important facets in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. The knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of stroke, in particular, DNA methylation, which makes a significant contribution to the development and formation of cerebral damage, is becoming more and more relevant. This review reflects an analysis of animal studies proving the relationship of DNA methylation with cerebral ischemia. As a result of the search work, 282 articles from the PubMed database were selected for keywords that corresponded to this topic. Of these publications, 8 studies were devoted to genome-wide DNA methylation, and 6 published the results of DNA methylation of candidate genes in experimental cerebral ischemia. The results have demonstrated that brain DNA methylation in animals is associated with the development of ischemic stroke and may play a role in several pathogenetic mechanisms. In two studies, a decrease in the level of DNA methylation in 2 genes in ischemic brain tissues of laboratory animals was found, at the same time, in four studies, 8 genes, in which methylation increased after ischemic stroke, were reported. These data suggest that the assessment of the level of DNA methylation in stroke is a promising biomarker for the search and improvement of pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for limiting brain damage in ischemic and reperfusion injury at the stages of preclinical and clinical studies.",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Disordered APP metabolism and neurovasculature in trauma and aging: Combined risks for chronic neurodegenerative disorders.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), advanced age, and cerebral vascular disease are factors conferring increased risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). These conditions are also related pathologically through multiple interacting mechanisms. The hallmark pathology of AD consists of pathological aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and tau proteins. These molecules are also involved in neuropathology of several other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and are under intense investigation in the aftermath of TBI as potential contributors to the risk for developing AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The pathology of TBI is complex and dependent on injury severity, age-at-injury, and length of time between injury and neuropathological evaluation. In addition, the mechanisms influencing pathology and recovery after TBI likely involve genetic/epigenetic factors as well as additional disorders or comorbid states related to age and central and peripheral vascular health. In this regard, dysfunction of the aging neurovascular system could be an important link between TBI and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, either as a precipitating event or related to accumulation of AD-like pathology which is amplified in the context of aging. Thus with advanced age and vascular dysfunction, TBI can trigger self-propagating cycles of neuronal injury, pathological protein aggregation, and synaptic loss resulting in chronic neurodegenerative disease. In this review we discuss evidence supporting TBI and aging as dual, interacting risk factors for AD, and the role of Aβ and cerebral vascular dysfunction in this relationship. Evidence is discussed that Aβ is involved in cyto- and synapto-toxicity after severe TBI, and that its chronic effects are potentiated by aging and impaired cerebral vascular function. From a therapeutic perspective, we emphasize that in the fields of TBI- and aging-related neurodegeneration protective strategies should include preservation of neurovascular function.",Ageing research reviews
Photocarcinogenesis: an overview.,"Photocarcinogenesis represents the sum of a complex of simultaneous and sequential biochemical events that ultimately lead to the occurrence of skin cancer.

The epigenetic influences may include immunological responses, antioxidant defenses, and dietary factors. This review represents an effort to provide current research results in the aforementioned areas and an attempt to meld these events into a comprehensive overview of photocarcinogenesis.

Amifostine-Loaded Nanocarrier Traverses the Blood-Brain Barrier and Prevents Radiation-Induced Brain Injury.,"Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is a severe, irreversible, or even life-threatening cerebral complication of radiotherapy in patients with head and neck tumors, and there is no satisfying prevention and effective treatment available for these patients. Amifostine (AMF) is a well-known free radical scavenger with demonstrated effectiveness in preventing radiation-induced toxicity. However, the limited permeability of AMF across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) when administered intravenously reduces the effectiveness of AMF in preventing RIBI. Herein, we construct a nanoparticle (NP) platform for BBB delivery of AMF. AMF is conjugated with 1,2-dioleoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-<i>n</i>-[poly(ethylene glycol)]-hydroxy succinamide [DSPE-PEG-NHS, PEG M 2000], and the product is DSPE-PEG-AMF. Then, the nanoparticles (DAPP NPs) were formed by self-assembly of poly(lactic-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid) (PLGA), DSPE-PEG-AMF, and polysorbate 80 (PS 80). PEG shields the nanoparticles from blood clearance by the reticuloendothelial system and lengthens the drug circulation time. PS 80 is used to encapsulate nanoparticles for medication delivery to the brain. The results of our study showed that DAPP NPs were able to effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in healthy C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, in a well-established mouse model of X-knife-induced brain injury, treatment with DAPP NPs (corresponding to 250 mg/kg AMF) was found to significantly reduce the volume of brain necrosis compared to mice treated with AMF (250 mg/kg). Importantly, the use of DAPP NPs was also shown to significantly mitigate the effects of radiation-induced neuronal damage and glial activation. This work presents a convenient brain-targeted AMF delivery system to achieve effective radioprotection for the brain, providing a promising strategy with tremendous clinical translation potential.",ACS applied materials & interfaces
Epigenetic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and acute brain injury.,"Epigenetic modifications are emerging as major players in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and susceptibility to acute brain injury. DNA and histone modifications act together with non-coding RNAs to form a complex gene expression machinery that adapts the brain to environmental stressors and injury response. These modifications influence cell-level operations like neurogenesis and DNA repair to large, intricate processes such as brain patterning, memory formation, motor function and cognition. Thus, epigenetic imbalance has been shown to influence the progression of many neurological disorders independent of aberrations in the genetic code. This review aims to highlight ways in which epigenetics applies to several commonly researched neurodegenerative diseases and forms of acute brain injury as well as shed light on the benefits of epigenetics-based treatments.",Neurochemistry international
Adenosine kinase: An epigenetic modulator in development and disease.,"Adenosine kinase (ADK) is the key regulator of adenosine and catalyzes the metabolism of adenosine to 5'-adenosine monophosphate. The enzyme exists in two isoforms: a long isoform (ADK-long, ADK-L) and a short isoform (ADK-short, ADK-S). The two isoforms are developmentally regulated and are differentially expressed in distinct subcellular compartments with ADK-L localized in the nucleus and ADK-S localized in the cytoplasm. The nuclear localization of ADK-L and its biochemical link to the transmethylation pathway suggest a specific role for gene regulation via epigenetic mechanisms. Recent evidence reveals an adenosine receptor-independent role of ADK in determining the global methylation status of DNA and thereby contributing to epigenomic regulation. Here we summarize recent progress in understanding the biochemical interactions between adenosine metabolism by ADK-L and epigenetic modifications linked to transmethylation reactions. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of ADK-associated changes in DNA methylation in developmental, as well as in pathological conditions including brain injury, epilepsy, vascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. Challenges in investigating the epigenetic role of ADK for therapeutic gains are briefly discussed.",Neurochemistry international
Chronic neurodegenerative consequences of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health concern and a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Each year, an estimated 1.7 million Americans sustain TBI of which ~52,000 people die, ~275,000 people are hospitalized and 1,365,000 people are treated as emergency outpatients. Currently there are ~5.3 million Americans living with TBI. TBI is more of a disease process than of an event that is associated with immediate and long-term sensomotor, psychological and cognitive impairments. TBI is the best known established epigenetic risk factor for later development of neurodegenerative diseases and dementia. People sustaining TBI are ~4 times more likely to develop dementia at a later stage than people without TBI. Single brain injury is linked to later development of symptoms resembling Alzheimer's disease while repetitive brain injuries are linked to later development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and/or Dementia Pugilistica (DP). Furthermore, genetic background of ß-amyloid precursor protein (APP), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), presenilin (PS) and neprilysin (NEP) genes is associated with exacerbation of neurodegenerative process after TBI.

Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA): a target in neuropathic pain.,"Current treatments for neuropathic pain are limited in part due to the incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Recent evidence reveals the dysregulated expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the damaged nerve, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and spinal cord dorsal horn following peripheral nerve injury. However, the role of the majority of lncRNAs in neuropathic pain genesis is still elusive. Unveiling the mechanisms of how lncRNAs participate in neuropathic pain may develop new strategies to prevent and/or treat this disorder. Areas covered: This review focuses on the dysregulation of lncRNAs in the DRG, dorsal horn, and the injured nerves from preclinical models of neuropathic pain. We provide evidence of how peripheral nerve injury causes the dysregulation of lncRNAs in these pain-related regions. The potential mechanisms of how dysregulated lncRNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain are discussed. Expert opinion: The investigation on the role of the dysregulated lncRNAs in neuropathic pain might open up a novel avenue for therapeutic treatment of this disorder. However, current investigation is at the infancy stage, which challenges the translation of preclinical findings. More intensive studies on lncRNAs are required before the preclinical findings are translated into therapeutic management for neuropathic pain.",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets
Epigenetic modulation of macrophage polarization- perspectives in diabetic wounds.,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that poses a global burden to healthcare. Increasing incidence of diabetes-related complications in the affected population includes a delay in wound healing that often results in non-traumatic limb amputations. Owing to the intricacies of the healing process and crosstalk between the multitude of participating cells, the identification of hyperglycaemia-induced changes at both cellular and molecular levels poses a challenge. Macrophages are one of the key participants in wound healing and continue to exert functional changes at the wound site since the time of injury. In the present review, we discuss the role of these cells and their aberrant functions in diabetic wounds. We have extensively studied the process of macrophage polarization (MP) and its modulation through epigenetic modifications. Data from both pre-clinical and clinical studies on diabetes have co-related hyperglycaemia induced changes in gene expression to an increased incidence of diabetic complications. Hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress, create an environment prone to changes in the epigenetic code, that is manifested as an altered inflammatory gene expression. Here, we have attempted to understand the different epigenetic modulations that possibly contribute towards dysregulated MP, resulting in delayed wound healing.",Journal of diabetes and its complications
Individual response of the ocular lens to ionizing radiation.,"Cataract (opacification of the ocular lens) is a typical tissue reaction (deterministic effect) following ionizing radiation exposure, for which prevention dose limits have been recommended in the radiation protection system. Manifestations of radiation cataracts can vary among individuals, but such potential individual responses remain uncharacterized. Here we review relevant literature and discuss implications for radiation protection. This review assesses evidence for significant modification of radiation-induced cataractogenesis by age at exposure, sex and genetic factors based on current scientific literature.",International journal of radiation biology
DNA Methylation and Non-Coding RNAs during Tissue-Injury Associated Pain.,"While about half of the population experience persistent pain associated with tissue damages during their lifetime, current symptom-based approaches often fail to reduce such pain to a satisfactory level. To provide better patient care, mechanism-based analgesic approaches must be developed, which necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the nociceptive mechanism leading to tissue injury-associated persistent pain. Epigenetic events leading the altered transcription in the nervous system are pivotal in the maintenance of pain in tissue injury. However, the mechanisms through which those events contribute to the persistence of pain are not fully understood. This review provides a summary and critical evaluation of two epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation and non-coding RNA expression, on transcriptional modulation in nociceptive pathways during the development of tissue injury-associated pain. We assess the pre-clinical data and their translational implication and evaluate the potential of controlling DNA methylation and non-coding RNA expression as novel analgesic approaches and/or biomarkers of persistent pain.",International journal of molecular sciences
